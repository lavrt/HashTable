James Bowen A STREET CAT NAMED BOB HOW ONE MAN AND HIS CAT FOUND HOPE ON THE STREETS Chapter 1 Fellow Travellers Theres a famous quote I read somewhere It says we are all given second chances every day of our lives They are there for the taking its just that we dont usually take them I spent a big chunk of my life proving that quote I was given a lot of opportunities sometimes on a daily basis For a long time I failed to take any of them but then in the early spring of 2007 that finally began to change It was then that I befriended Bob Looking back on it something tells me it might have been his second chance too I first encountered him on a gloomy Thursday evening in March London hadnt quite shaken off the winter and it was still bitingly cold on the streets especially when the winds blew in off the Thames There had even been a hint of frost in the air that night which was why Id arrived back at my new sheltered accommodation in Tottenham north London a little earlier than usual after a day busking around Covent Garden As normal I had my black guitar case and rucksack slung over my shoulders but this evening I also had my closest friend Belle with me Wed gone out together years ago but were just mates now We were going to eat a cheap takeaway curry and watch a movie on the small black and white television set Id managed to find in a charity shop round the corner As usual the lift in the apartment block wasnt working so we headed for the first flight of stairs resigned to making the long trudge up to the fifth floor The strip lighting in the hallway was broken and part of the ground floor was swathed in darkness but as we made our way to the stairwell I couldnt help noticing a pair of glowing eyes in the gloom When I heard a gentle slightly plaintive meowing I realised what it was Edging closer in the halflight I could see a ginger cat curled up on a doormat outside one of the groundfloor flats in the corridor that led off the hallway Id grown up with cats and had always had a bit of a soft spot for them As I moved in and got a good look I could tell he was a tom a male I hadnt seen him around the flats before but even in the darkness I could tell there was something about him I could already tell that he had something of a personality He wasnt in the slightest bit nervous in fact completely the opposite There was a quiet unflappable confidence about him He looked like he was very much at home here in the shadows and to judge by the way he was fixing me with a steady curious intelligent stare I was the one who was straying into his territory It was as if he was saying So who are you and what brings you here I couldnt resist kneeling down and introducing myself Hello mate Ive not seen you before do you live here I said He just looked at me with the same studious slightly aloof expression as if he was still weighing me up I decided to stroke his neck partly to make friends but partly to see if he was wearing a collar or any form of identification It was hard to tell in the dark but I realised there was nothing which immediately suggested to me that he was a stray London had more than its fair share of those He seemed to be enjoying the affection and began brushing himself lightly against me As I petted him a little more I could feel that his coat was in poor condition with uneven bald patches here and there He was clearly in need of a good meal From the way he was rubbing against me he was also in need of a bit of TLC Poor chap I think hes a stray Hes not got a collar and hes really thin I said looking up at Belle who was waiting patiently by the foot of the stairs She knew I had a weakness for cats No James you cant have him she said nodding towards the door of the flat that the cat was sitting outside He cant have just wandered in here and settled on this spot he must belong to whoever lives there Probably waiting for them to come home and let him in Reluctantly I agreed with her I couldnt just pick up a cat and take him home with me even if all the signs pointed to the fact it was homeless Id barely moved into this place myself and was still trying to sort out my flat What if it did belong to the person living in that flat They werent going to take too kindly to someone carrying off their pet were they Besides the last thing I needed right now was the extra responsibility of a cat I was a failed musician and recovering drug addict living a handtomouth existence in sheltered accommodation Taking responsibility for myself was hard enough The following morning Friday I headed downstairs to find the ginger tom still sitting there It was as if he hadnt shifted from the same spot in the past twelve hours or so Once again I dropped down on one knee and stroked him Once again it was obvious that he loved it He was purring away appreciating the attention he was getting He hadnt learned to trust me 100 per cent yet But I could tell he thought I was OK In the daylight I could see that he was a gorgeous creature He had a really striking face with amazingly piercing green eyes although looking closer I could tell that he must have been in a fight or an accident because there were scratches on his face and legs As Id guessed the previous evening his coat was in very poor condition It was very thin and wiry in places with at least half a dozen bald patches where you could see the skin I was now feeling genuinely concerned about him but again I told myself that I had more than enough to worry about getting myself straightened out So more than a little reluctantly I headed off to catch the bus from Tottenham to central London and Covent Garden where I was going to once more try and earn a few quid busking By the time I got back that night it was pretty late almost ten oclock I immediately headed for the corridor where Id seen the ginger tom but there was no sign of him Part of me was disappointed Id taken a bit of a shine to him But mostly I felt relieved I assumed he must have been let in by his owner when theyd got back from wherever it was they had been My heart sank a bit when I went down again the next day and saw him back in the same position again By now he was slightly more vulnerable and dishevelled than before He looked cold and hungry and he was shaking a little Still here then I said stroking him Not looking so good today I decided that this had gone on for long enough So I knocked on the door of the flat I felt I had to say something If this was their pet it was no way to treat him He needed something to eat and drink and maybe even some medical attention A guy appeared at the door He was unshaven wearing a Tshirt and a pair of tracksuit bottoms and looked like hed been sleeping even though it was the middle of the afternoon Sorry to bother you mate Is this your cat I asked him For a second he looked at me as if I was slightly mad What cat he said before looking down and seeing the ginger tom curled up in a ball on the doormat Oh No he said with a disinterested shrug Nothing to do with me mate Hes been there for days I said again drawing a blank look Has he Must have smelled cooking or something Well as I say nothing to do with me He then slammed the door shut I made my mind up immediately OK mate you are coming with me I said digging into my rucksack for the box of biscuits I carried specifically to give treats to the cats and dogs that regularly approached me when I was busking I rattled it at him and he was immediately up on all fours following me I could see he was a bit uneasy on his feet and was carrying one of his back legs in an awkward manner so we took our time climbing the five flights of stairs A few minutes later we were safely ensconced in my flat My flat was threadbare its fair to say Apart from the telly all I had in there was a secondhand sofa bed a mattress in the corner of the small bedroom and in the kitchen area a halfworking refrigerator a microwave a kettle and a toaster There was no cooker The only other things in the flat were my books videos and knickknacks Im a bit of a magpie I collect all sorts of stuff from the street At that time I had a broken parking meter in one corner and a broken mannequin with a cowboy hat on its head in another A friend once called my place the old curiosity shop but as he sussed out his new environment the only thing the tom was curious about was the kitchen I fished out some milk from the fridge poured it into a saucer and mixed it with a bit of water I know that contrary to popular opinion milk can be bad for cats because in fact they are actually lactose intolerant He lapped it up in seconds I had a bit of tuna in the fridge so I mixed it up with some mashed up biscuits and gave that to him as well Again he wolfed it downPoor thing he must be absolutely starving I thought to myself After the cold and dark of the corridor the flat was fivestar luxury as far as the tom was concerned He seemed very pleased to be there and after being fed in the kitchen he headed for the living room where he curled up on the floor near the radiator As I sat and watched him more carefully there was no doubt in my mind that there was something wrong with his leg Sure enough when I sat on the floor next to him and started examining him I found that he had a big abscess on the back of his rear right leg The wound was the size of a large caninelike tooth which gave me a good idea how hed got it Hed probably been attacked by a dog or possibly a fox that had stuck its teeth into his leg and clung on to him as hed tried to escape He also had a lot of scratches one on his face not far from his eye and others on his coat and legs I sterilised the wound as best as I could by putting him in the bathtub then putting some nonalcoholic moisturiser around the wound and some Vaseline on the wound itself A lot of cats would have created havoc if Id tried to treat them like that but he was as good as gold He spent most of the rest of the day curled up on what was already his favourite spot near the radiator But he also roamed around the flat a bit every now and again jumping up and scratching at whatever he could find Having ignored it earlier on he now began to find the mannequin in the corner a bit of a magnet I didnt mind He could do whatever he liked to it I knew ginger toms could be very lively and could tell he had a lot of pentup energy When I went to stroke him he jumped up and started pawing at me At one point he got quite animated scratching furiously and almost cutting my hand OK mate calm down I said lifting him off me and putting him down on the floor I knew that young males who hadnt been neutered could become extremely lively My guess was that he was still complete and was well into puberty I couldnt be sure of course but it again underlined the nagging feeling that he must have come off the streets rather than from a home I spent the evening watching television the tom curled up by the radiator seemingly content to be there He only moved when I went to bed picking himself up and following me into the bedroom where he wrapped himself up into a ball by my feet at the edge of the bed As I listened to his gentle purring in the dark it felt good to have him there He was company I guess Id not had a lot of that lately On Sunday morning I got up reasonably early and decided to hit the streets to see if I could find his owner I figured that someone might have stuck up aLost Cat poster There was almost always a photocopied appeal for the return of a missing pet plastered on local lampposts noticeboards and even bus stops There seemed to be so many missing moggies that there were times when I wondered whether there was a catnapping gang at work in the area Just in case I found the owner quickly I took the cat with me attaching him to a leash Id made out of a shoelace to keep him safe He was happy to walk by my side as we took the stairs to the ground floor Outside the block of flats the cat began pulling on the string lead as if he wanted to head off I guessed that he wanted to do his business Sure enough he headed off into a patch of greenery and bushes adjoining a neighbouring building and disappeared for a minute or two to heed natures call He then returned to me and happily slipped back into the lead He must really trust me I thought to myself I immediately felt that I had to repay that trust and try and help him out My first port of call was the lady who lived across the street She was known locally for looking after cats She fed the neighbourhood strays and got them neutered if necessary When she opened the door I saw at least five cats living inside Goodness knows how many more she had out the back It seemed that every cat for miles headed to her backyard knowing it was the best place to get some food I didnt know how she could afford to feed them all She saw the tom and took a shine to him straight away offering him a little treat She was a lovely lady but didnt know anything about where hed come from Shed not seen him around the area I bet hes come from somewhere else in London Wouldnt surprise me if hes been dumped she said She said shed keep her eyes and ears open in case she heard anything I had a feeling she was right about him being from somewhere far from Tottenham Out of interest I took the cat off his lead to see if he knew what direction to go in But as we walked the streets it was obvious he didnt know where he was He seemed completely lost He looked at me as if to say I dont know where I am I want to stay with you We were out for a few hours At one point he scurried off into a bush to do his business again leaving me to ask any passing locals whether they recognised him All I got was blank looks and shrugs It was obvious that he didnt want to leave me As we wandered around I couldnt help wondering about his story where hed come from and what sort of life hed led before hed come and sat on the mat downstairs Part of me was convinced that thecat lady across the street was right and he was a family pet He was a finelooking cat and had probably been bought for Christmas or someones birthday Gingers can be a bit mental and worse if not neutered as Id already seen They can get very dominant much more so than other cats My hunch was that when hed become boisterous and frisky he had also become a little too much to handle I imagined the parents sayingenough is enough and rather than taking him to a refuge or the RSPCA sticking him in the back of the family car taking him for a drive and throwing him out into the street or on to the roadside Cats have a great sense of direction but hed obviously been let loose far from home and hadnt gone back Or maybe hed known that it wasnt really home at all and decided to find a new one My other theory was that hed belonged to an old person who had passed away Of course it was possible that wasnt the case at all The fact that he wasnt housetrained was the main argument against him having been domesticated But the more I got to know him the more convinced I was that he had definitely been used to being around one person He seemed to latch on to people whom he thought would look after him Thats what hed done with me The biggest clue about his background was his injury which looked nasty Hed definitely picked that up in a fight From the way it was leaking pus the wound must have been a few days old maybe even a week That suggested another possibility to me London has always had a large population of street cats strays who wander the streets living off scraps and the comfort of strangers Five or six hundred years ago places like Gresham Street in the City Clerkenwell Green and Drury Lane used to be known ascat streets and were overrun with them These strays are the flotsam and jetsam of the city running around fighting for survival on a daily basis A lot of them were like this ginger tom slightly battered broken creatures Maybe hed spotted a kindred spirit in me Chapter 2 Road to Recovery Id been around cats since I was a child and I felt like I had a pretty good understanding of them While I was growing up my family had several Siamese and I remember that at one stage we also had a beautiful tortoiseshell cat My memories of all of them were generally fond ones but inevitably Isuppose the one that stuck most vividly in my mind was the darkest Id grown up in England and Australia and for a while wed lived in a place called Craigie in Western Australia While we were there we had a lovely white fluffy kitten I cant remember where we got it from but I have a feeling it might have been from a local farmer Wherever it had come from it was a terrible home For whatever reason it hadnt been checked out medically before being handed over to us It turned out the poor little thing was flearidden It hadnt been immediately apparent The problem was that because the kitten had such thick white fur the fleas were festering in there and nobody knew Fleas are parasites of course They draw the life out of other creatures to sustain their own They basically drained this poor kitten of all its blood By the time we spotted it it was too late My mother took it to the vets but she was told that it had passed the point of no return It had all sorts of infections and other problems It died within a couple of weeks of us getting it I was five or six at the time and was devastated as was my mother Id thought about the kitten often over the years usually whenever I saw a white cat But he had been on my mind a lot this weekend as Id spent time with the tom I could tell his coat was in a bad state It really was threadbare in places I had an awful feeling that it would suffer the same fate as the white kitten Sitting in the flat with him that Sunday evening I made a decision I wasnt going to let that happen I wasnt going to assume that the care I had given him was going to make him better I wasnt going to take anything for granted I had to take him to a vet I knew my makeshift medication wasnt going to be good enough to heal the wound But I had no idea what other underlying health issues he might have I wasnt going to take the risk of waiting so I decided to get up early the next morning and take him to the nearest RSPCA centre down the other end of Seven Sisters Road towardsFinsbury Park I set my alarm early and got up to give the cat a bowl of mashed biscuits and tuna It was another grey morning but I knew I couldnt use that as an excuse Given the state of his leg I knew he wasnt going to be up to the ninetyminute walk so I decided to carry him and placed him in a green recycling box It wasnt ideal but I couldnt find anything else No sooner had we set off than it was clear that he didnt like it He kept moving sticking his paw over the top of the box and attempting to climb out So eventually I gave up Come on Ill carry you I said picking him up with my spare arm while carrying the recycling box in the other He was soon scrambling up on to my shoulders where he settled I let him sit there while I carried the empty box with me all the way to the RSPCA centre Inside the centre it was like stepping into a scene from hell It was packed mostly with dogs and their owners most of whom seemed to be young teenage blokes with skinhead haircuts and aggressive tattoos Seventy per cent of the dogs were Staffordshire Bull Terriers that had almost certainly been injured in fights with other dogs probably for peoples amusement People always talk about Britain as anation of animal lovers There wasnt much love on display here that was for sure The way some people treat their pets really disgusts me The cat sat on my lap or on my shoulder I could tell he was nervous and I couldnt blame him He was getting snarled at by most of the dogs in the waiting room One or two were being held tightly on their leashes as they strained to get closer to him One by one the dogs were ushered into the treatment room Each time the nurse appeared however we were disappointed In the end it took us four and a half hours to be seen Eventually she saidMr Bowen the vet will see you now He was a middleaged vet He had that kind of worldweary seenitall expression you see on some peoples faces Maybe it was all the aggression Id been surrounded by outside but I felt on edge with him immediately So what seems to be the problem he asked me I knew the guy was only doing his job but I felt like sayingWell if I knew that I wouldnt be here but resisted the temptation I told him how Id found the cat in the hallway of my building and pointed out the abscess on the back of his leg OK lets have a quick look at him he said He could tell the cat was in pain and gave him a small dose of diazepam to help relieve it He then explained that he was going to issue a prescription for a twoweek course of catstrength amoxicillin Come back and see me again if things havent improved in a fortnight he said I thought Id take the opportunity and ask about fleas He had a quick look around his coat but said he could find nothing But its probably worth you giving him some tablets for that It can be a problem in young cats he said Again I resisted the temptation to tell him that I knew that I watched as he wrote a prescription out for that as well To his credit he also checked to see if the tom was microchipped He wasnt which again suggested to me he was a street cat You should get that done when you have a chance he said I think he should also be neutered quite soon as well he added handing me a brochure and a form advertising a free neutering scheme for strays Given the way he tore around the house and was so boisterous with me I nodded in agreement with his diagnosis I think thats a good idea I smiled expecting him to at least ask a followup why But the vet didnt seem interested He was only concerned with tapping his notes into a computer screen and printing off the prescription We were obviously on a production line that needed to be processed and pushed out the door ready for the next patient to come in It wasnt his fault it was the system Within a few minutes we were finished Leaving the vets surgery I went up to the counter at the dispensary and handed over the prescription The whitecoated lady there was a bit friendlier Hes a lovelylooking fellow she said My mum had a ginger tom once Best companion she ever had Amazing temperament Used to sit there at her feet watching the world go by A bomb could have gone off and he wouldnt have left her She punched in the details to the till and produced a bill That will be twentytwo pounds please love she said My heart sank Twentytwo pounds Really I said I had just over thirty pounds in the whole world at that point Afraid so love the nurse said looking sympathetic but implacable at the same time I handed over the thirty pounds in cash and took the change It was a lot of money for me A days wages But I knew I had no option I couldnt let my new friend down Looks like were stuck with each other for the next fortnight I said to the tom as we headed out of the door and began the long walk back to the flat It was the truth There was no way I was going to get rid of the cat for at least a fortnight not until he completed his course of medicine No one else was going to make sure he took his tablets and I couldnt let him out on the streets in case he picked up an infection I dont know why but the responsibility of having him to look after galvanised me a little bit I felt like I had an extra purpose in my life something positive to do for someone or something other than myself That afternoon I headed to a local pet store and got him a couple of weeks worth of food Id been given a sample of scientific formula food at the RSPCA and tried it on him the previous night Hed liked it so I bought a bag of that I also got him a supply of cat food It cost me around nine pounds which really was the last money I had That night I had to leave him on his own and head to Covent Garden with my guitar I now had two mouths to feed Over the course of the next few days as I nursed him back to health I got to know him a little better By now Id given him a name Bob I got the idea while watching a DVD of one of my old favourite TV seriesTwin Peaks There was a character in that called Killer Bob He was actually schizophrenic a kind of Jekyll and Hyde character Part of the time he would be a normal sane guy the next he would be kind of crazy and out of control The tom was a bit like that When he was happy and content you couldnt have wished to see a calmer kinder cat But when the mood took him he could be an absolute maniac charging around the flat I was talking to my friend Belle one night when it dawned on me Hes a bit like Killer Bob inTwin Peaks I said drawing a blank look from her But it didnt matter Bob it was It was pretty clear to me now that Bob must have lived outdoors When it came to toilet time he absolutely refused to go in the litter tray that Id bought for him Instead I had to take him downstairs and let him do his business in the gardens that surrounded the flats Hed dash off into a bit of overgrowth and do whatever was needed then scratch up the ground to cover up the evidence Watching him going through his ritual one morning I wondered whether hed belonged to travellers There were quite a few of them around the Tottenham area In fact there was a camp of them on some land near my block of flats Maybe hed been part of a travelling family and had somehow got left behind when they moved on He was definitely not a house cat that much I knew now There was no doubt that he was forming an affection for me As indeed I was for him At first he had been affectionate but still a bit wary of me But as the days passed he became more and more confident and friendly He could still be very boisterous and even aggressive at times But by now I knew that was down to the fact that he needed to be neutered Our life settled into a bit of a routine Id leave Bob in the flat in the morning and head to Covent Garden where Id play until I got enough cash When I got home hed be waiting for me at the front door He would then follow me to the sofa in the front room and watch telly with me By now I was beginning to realise what a smart cat he was I could see that he understood everything I was saying to him When I patted the sofa and invited him to come and sit next to me he did He also knew what I meant when I told him it was time for him to have his meds Each time he would look at me as if to sayDo I have to But he wouldnt struggle while I put tablets in his mouth and rubbed his throat gently until he swallowed it Most cats would go mad if you try to open their mouths But he already trusted me It was around that point I began to realise there was something rather special about him Id certainly never encountered a cat quite like Bob He wasnt perfect by any means He knew where the food lived and would regularly crash around the kitchen knocking over pots and pans as he searched for food The cupboards and fridge door already bore scratch marks from where hed been frantically trying to get access to something tasty to eat To be fair to him he listened if I said no All I had to do was sayNo get away from there Bob and hed slink off Again it showed how intelligent he was And again it raised all sorts of questions about his background Would a feral or a street cat pay attention to what a human told them in that way I doubted it I really enjoyed Bobs company but I knew I had to be careful I couldnt form too strong a friendship because sooner or later he would want to return to the streets He wasnt the sort of cat that was going to enjoy being cooped up permanently He wasnt a house cat For the short term however I was his guardian and I was determined to try and fulfil that role to the best of my ability I knew I needed to do all I could to prepare him for his return to the streets so one morning I filled in the form the RSPCA vet had given me for the free neutering service I stuck it in the post and to my mild amazement got a reply within a couple of days The letter contained a certificate entitling us to a free neutering The next morning I took Bob down to do his business outside again The litter trays Id bought him remained unsoiled and unused He just didnt like them He headed for the same spot in the bushes adjoining the neighbouring houses It seemed to be a favourite area for some reason I suspected it was something to do with him marking his territory something Id read about in a science article somewhere As usual he was in there for a minute or two then spent some time afterwards clearing up after him The cleanliness and tidiness of cats never ceases to amaze me Why was it so important to them He had satisfied himself that everything was right and was making his way out when he suddenly froze and tensed up as if hed seen something I was about to go over to see what was bothering him when it became quite obvious what it was All of a sudden Bob lunged forward at lightning speed It really did all happen in a blur Before I knew it Bob had grabbed at something in the grass near the hedge I moved in to take a closer look and saw that it was a little grey mouse no more than three inches long The little fellow had clearly been trying to scurry past him but hadnt stood a chance Bob had pounced with lightning speed and precision and now had the creature clamped between his teeth It wasnt the prettiest of sights The mouses legs were thrashing around and Bob was carefully repositioning its body in his teeth so that he could finish off the mouse It wasnt long before the inevitable happened and the little creature gave up the fight It was at that point that Bob released it from his mouth and laid it on the ground I knew what was likely to happen next but I didnt want Bob to eat it Mice were notorious breeding grounds for disease So I knelt down and attempted to pick up his prey He wasnt too happy about it and made a little noise that was part growl and part hiss He then picked the mouse up again Give it to me Bob I said refusing to back down Give it to me He really wasnt too keen and this time gave me a look as if to say Why should I I fished around in my coat and found a nibble offering him a tradeTake this instead Bob it will be much better for you He still wasnt convinced but after a few more moments the standoff came to a halt and he gave in As soon as he stepped away from the mouse I picked it up by its tail and disposed of it It was another reminder of what to me anyway is one of the many fascinating things about cats they are lethal predators by nature A lot of people dont like to think of their cute little kitty as a mass murderer but thats what cats are given half a chance In some parts of the world including Australia they have strict rules on cats being let out at night because of the carnage they cause in the local bird and rodent population Bob had proven the point His coolness his speed and his skill as a killer was amazing to behold He knew exactly what to do and how to do it It set me thinking again about the life he must have led before he had arrived in the hallway of the block of flats What sort of existence had it been Where had he lived and how had he survived Had he relied on finding and eating prey like this every day Had he been raised in a domestic environment or had he always lived off the land like this How had he become the cat he was today I would love to have known I was sure my street cat friend had a tale or two to tell In many ways this was something else that Bob and I had in common Ever since Id ended up living rough on the streets people had wondered about my past life How had I landed myself in this position theyd ask me Some did it professionally of course Id spoken to dozens of social workers psychologists and even police officers whod quizzed me about how Id ended up living on the streets But a lot of ordinary people would ask me about it too I dont know why but people seem to be fascinated to learn how some members of society fall through the cracks I think its partly that feeling that there for the grace of God go I that it could happen to anyone But I think it also makes people feel better about their own lives It makes them think Well I may think my life is bad but it could be worse I could be that poor sod The answer to how people like me end up on the streets is always different of course But there are usually some similarities Often drugs and alcohol play a big part in the story But in an awful lot of instances the road that led them to living on the streets stretches all the way back to their childhoods and their relationship with their family That was certainly the way it was for me I lived quite a rootless childhood mainly because I spent it travelling between the UK and Australia I was born in Surrey but when I was three my family moved to Melbourne My mother and father had separated by this time While my father stayed in Surrey my mother had got away from all the aggravation by landing a job selling for Rank Xerox the photocopying company in Melbourne She was really good at it too she was one of the companys top saleswomen My mother had itchy feet however and within about two years we had moved from Melbourne to Western Australia We stayed there for about three or four years until I was nine or so Life in Australia was pretty good We lived in a succession of large bungalows each of which had vast garden areas at the back I had all the space a boy could want to play in and explore the world and I loved the Australian landscape The trouble was that I didnt have any friends I found it very hard to fit in at school mainly I think because wed moved a lot The chances of me settling into life in Australia disappeared when I was nine and we moved back to the UK and to Sussex near Horsham I enjoyed being back in England and have some happy memories of that period I was just getting back into life in the northern hemisphere when we had to move yet again back to Western Australia when I was around twelve This time we ended up in a place called Quinns Rock It was there that I think a lot of my problems really began Because of all this travelling around we never lived in one house for more than a couple of years My mother was always buying and selling moving all the time I never had a family home and never grew up in one place We weredefinitely living some kind of gypsylike existence Im no psychologist although Ive met my fair share of them over the years There is no doubt in my mind that we moved home way too much and it was not good for a growing child It made it very hard for me to become socially adept At school it was very hard to make friends I was always trying too hard I was too eager to impress which isnt good when you are a kid It had the opposite result I ended up being bullied at every school I went to It was particularly bad in Quinns Rock I probably stuck out with a British accent and my eagertoplease attitude I was a sitting target really One day they decided to stone me Literally Quinns Rock was called Quinns Rock for a reason and these kids took advantage of all the nice lumps of limestone that were lying around wherever you looked I got concussion after being bombarded on the way home from school Things werent helped by the fact that I didnt get on at all with my stepfather at the time a guy called Nick In my teenage opinion he was a prick and that was what I called him Nick the Prick My mother had met him when she joined the police back in Horsham and he had come with her out to Australia We continued living this same nomadic existence throughout my early teens It was usually connected to my mothers many business ventures She was a very successful woman At one point she started doing telemarketing training videos That did quite well for a while Then she set up a womans magazine calledCity Woman which didnt do so well Sometimes wed have plenty of money and other times wed be strapped for cash But that never lasted for long she was a proper entrepreneur By the time I was in my midteens Id pretty much quit school I left because I was just sick to death of the bullying I encountered there I didnt get along with Nick either And I was very independentminded I became a tearaway a wild kid who was always out late always defying my mother and generally thumbing his nose at authority no matter what form it took It wasnt surprising that I had soon developed a knack for getting myself into trouble something I have never quite shaken off Predictably I got into drugs at first sniffing glue probably to escape from reality I didnt get addicted to it I only did it a couple of times after seeing another kid doing it But it was the start of the process After that I started smoking dope and sniffing toluene an industrial solvent you find in nail varnish and glue It was all connected it was all part of a cycle of behaviour one thing led back to another which led back to another and so on I was angry I felt like I hadnt had the best breaks Show me the child of seven and Ill show you the man they say Im not so sure that youd have spotted my future when I was seven but you could certainly have guessed what lay ahead when I was seventeen I was set on the road to selfdestruction My mother tried her hardest to get me off drugs She could see the damage I was doing and the even worse problems I was going to cause myself if I didnt kick the habits I was forming She did all the things mothers do She went through my pockets trying to find drugs and even locked me in my bedroom a few times But the locks in our house were those ones with buttons in themiddle I learned to pick them really easily with a Bobby pin They just popped out and I was free I wasnt going to be hemmed in by her or anyone else for that matter We argued even more then of course and inevitably things went from bad to worse Mum got me to go to a psychiatrist at one point They diagnosed me with everything from schizophrenia to manic depression to ADHD or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Of course I thought it was all bullshit I was a messedup teenager who thought he knew better than everyone With the benefit of hindsight I can see that my mother must have been worried sick She must have felt powerless and terrified of what was going to happen to me But I was oblivious to other peoples feelings I didnt care and I didnt listen to anyone The situation got so bad between us that for a while I lived in Christian charity accommodation I just passed my time away there taking drugs and playing guitar Not necessarily in that order Around my eighteenth birthday I announced that I was going to move back to London to live with my halfsister from my fathers previous marriage It marked the beginning of the downward spiral At the time it had seemed like I was setting out into the world like any normal teenager My mother had taken me to the airport and dropped me off in the car Wed come to a stop at a red light and Id jumped out giving her a peck on the cheek and a wave goodbye We were both thinking that Id be gone for six months or so That was the plan I would stay for six months hang out with my halfsister and pursue my grand dreams of making it as a musician But things wouldnt exactly go to plan At first I went to stay with my halfsister in south London My brotherinlaw hadnt taken too kindly to my arrival As I say I was a rebellious teenager who dressed like a Goth and was probably a complete pain in the arse especially as I wasnt contributing to the household bills In Australia Id worked in IT and sold mobile phones but back in the UK I couldnt land a decent job The first Id been able to get had been working as a bartender But my face hadnt fitted and theyd sacked me after using me to cover for other peoples holidays during Christmas 1997 As if that wasnt bad enough they wrote the dole office a letter saying Id quit the job which meant I couldnt collect the benefits I was eligible for by virtue of having been born in England After that Id been even less welcome in my brotherinlaws house Eventually my halfsister and he had kicked me out I had made contact with my dad and been to see him a couple of times but it was clear we werent going to be able to get on We barely knew each other so living there was out of the question I started sleeping on friends floors and sofas Soon I was leading a nomadic existence carrying my sleeping bag with me to various flats and squats around London Then when I ran out of floors I moved to the streets Things headed downwards fast from there Living on the streets of London strips away your dignity your identity your everything really Worst of all it strips away peoples opinion of you They see you are living on the streets and treat you as a nonperson They dont want anything to do with you Soon you havent got a real friend in the world While I was sleeping rough I managed to get a job working as a kitchen porter But they sacked me when they found out I was homeless even though Id done nothing wrong at work When you are homeless you really stand very little chance The one thing that might have saved me was going back to Australia I had a return ticket but lost my passport two weeks before the flight I had no paperwork and besides I didnt have the money to get a new one Any hope I had of getting back to my family in Australia disappeared And so in a way did I The next phase of my life was a fog of drugs drink petty crime and well hopelessness It wasnt helped by the fact that I developed a heroin habit I took it at first simply to help me get to sleep at night on the streets It anaesthetised me from the cold and the loneliness It took me to another place Unfortunately it had also taken a hold of my soul as well By 1998 I was totally dependent on it I probably came close to death a few times although to be honest I was so out of it at times that I had no idea During that period it didnt occur to me to contact anyone in my family I had disappeared off the face of the earth and I didnt really care I was too wrapped up in surviving Looking back at the time now I can only imagine that they must have been going through hell They must have been worried sick I got an inkling of the grief I was causing about a year after I had arrived in London and about nine months or so after Id taken to the streets I had made contact with my father when Id arrived in London but hadnt spoken to him in months It was around Christmas time that I decided to give him a call His wife my stepmother had answered the phone He refused to come to the phone and kept me waiting for a few minutes he was so angry with me Where the f have you been Weve all been worried sick about you he said when he had collected himself enough to talk to me I made some pathetic excuses but he just shouted at me He told me that my mother had been in contact with him desperately trying to find out where I was That was a measure of how worried shed become The two of them never spoke He shouted and screamed at me for fully five minutes I realise now it was a mixture of release and anger He had probably thought I was dead which in a way I had been That period of my life lasted a year or so Id eventually been picked up off the streets by a homeless charity Id stayed in various shelters Connections just off St Martins Lane was one of them Id been sleeping rough in the market next door around that time I ended up on whats known as the vulnerable housing list which qualified me as a priority for sheltered accommodation The problem was that for the best part of the next decade I ended up living in horrendous hostels BBs and houses sharing my space with heroin and crack addicts who would steal anything that wasnt nailed down Everything I had was stolen at some point I had to sleep with my most important possessions tucked inside my clothes Survival was all I could think about Inevitably my drug dependency got worse By the time I was in my late twenties my habit had got so bad I ended up in rehab I spent a couple of months getting straightened out and was then put on a drug rehabilitation programme For a while the daily trip to the chemist and the fortnightly bus ride to my drug dependency unit in Camden became the focus of my life They became an almost reflex Id get out of bed and go and do one or the other on autopilot as if in a daze which if Im honest I often was I did some counselling there as well I talked endlessly about my habit how it had started and how I was going to bring it to an end Its easy to come up with excuses for drug addiction but Im certain I know the reason for mine It was pure and simple loneliness Heroin allowed me to anaesthetise myself to my isolation to the fact that I didnt have family or a huge circle of friends I was on my own and strange and unfathomable as it will seem to most people heroin was my friend Deep down however I knew it was killing me literally So over a period of a few years Id moved off heroin on to methadone the synthetic opioid that is used as a substitute to wean morphine and heroin addicts off their habits By the spring of 2007 the plan was that I would eventually start weaning myself off that and get completely straight The move to the flat in Tottenham was a key part of that process It was an ordinary apartment block full of ordinary families I knew I had a chance to put my life back on track there To help pay the rent Id started busking in Covent Garden It wasnt much but it helped put food on the table and pay the gas and electricity It also helped to keep me on an even keel I knew it was my chance to turn the corner And I knew I had to take it this time If Id been a cat Id have been on my ninthlife Chapter 3 The Snip As we approached the end of Bobs second week of medication he was looking a lot brighter The wound at the back of his leg was healing nicely and the bald and thin patches on his coat had begun to disappear and were being replaced with new thicker fur He also seemed happier in his face his eyes had a more lustrous gleam to them There was a beautiful green and yellow glow to them that hadnt been there before He was definitely on the road to recovery and his boisterousness around the flat was the ultimate proof of it He had been a whirling dervish flying around the place since day one but in the past week or so hed become even more of a ball of energy I hadnt thought it possible There were times when he would jump and run around the place like some kind of maniac He would claw furiously at everything and anything he could find including me There were scratches on every wooden surface in the flat I even had scratches on the back of my hand and arm I didnt mind I knew it wasnt malicious and that he was only playing He had become such a menace in the kitchen where he would claw at the cupboards and fridge door in an attempt to break into my food supplies that Id had to buy a couple of cheap plastic childlocks I also had to be careful about leaving anything lying around that might become a plaything for him A pair of shoes or item of clothing could be scratched to bits within minutes All Bobs actions showed that there was something that needed to be done Id been around enough cats in my life to recognise the telltale signs He was a young male with way too much testosterone flying around his body There was no doubt in my mind that he needed neutering So a couple of days before his course of medicine finished I decided to call the local vets the Abbey Clinic on Dalston Lane I knew the pros and cons of keeping himentire and they were mostly cons If I didnt castrate him there would be times when Bobs hormones would completely take over and he just wouldnt be able to stop himself from roaming the streets in search of willing females It could mean that he would go missing for days even weeks at a time Hed also be far more likely to get run over and to get into fights with other cats As far as I knew that might have been the cause of the fight that had caused his injury Male toms are very protective of their territory and produce a distinctive odour to signal their patch Bob might have wandered into someone elses territory and paid the price I knew it was probably paranoia on my part but there was also a risk albeit a very small one of him contracting diseases like FeLV and FIV the feline equivalent of HIV if he wasnt neutered Last but far fromleast if he stayed with me he would also be a much calmer more eventempered pet He wouldnt be so prone to running around like a maniac all the time By contrast the pros in favour of doing nothing amounted to a very short list It would avoid him having to undergo a small bit of surgery That was about it It was a nobrainer I rang the vets surgery and spoke to a female nurse I explained my situation and asked whether he was eligible for a free operation She said yes provided I had a certificate from a vet which I did after my first visits to sort out his leg and get his flea and worm medications The only thing that worried me was the medication he was still taking I explained that he was coming to the end of a course of antibiotics but she said that shouldnt be a problem She recommended that I book him in for an operation in two days time Just bring him in and leave him with us in the morning If everything goes to plan youll be able to pick him up at the end of the day she said I got up nice and early on the day of the operation knowing that I had to get him into the surgery by 10am It was the first time that wed travelled any distance from the flat together since our visit to the RSPCA I hadnt let him out of the flat apart from to do his business downstairs because he was still on his antibiotics So I stuck him in the same green plastic recycling box Id used a fortnight earlier to take him to the RSPCA The weather was miserable so I took the lid and let it rest loosely on the box once we were out and about He wasnt much more comfortable in it that day than he was the first time I put him in it He kept sticking his head out and watching the world go by The Abbey Clinic is a small place sandwiched between a newsagent and a medical centre on a parade of shops on Dalston Lane We got there in plenty of time for his appointment and found the place packed It was the usual chaotic scene with dogs tugging on their owners leashes and growling at the cats inside their smart carriers Bob stood out like a sore thumb in his improvised carrier so was immediately a target for their aggression Once again there were several Staffies there with their Neanderthallooking owners Some cats would have bolted Im sure But Bob wasnt fazed at all He seemed to have placed his trust in me When my name was called out a young nurse in her twenties came out to meet us She had some paperwork and led me into a room where she asked me what were obviously standard questions Once its been carried out the operation cant be reversed So are you certain you dont want to breed from Bob at some future date she said I just smiled and nodded Yeah Im quite certain I said rubbing Bob on the head Her next question stumped me however And how old is Bob she smiled Ah I really dont know I said before briefly explaining his story Hmm lets take a look She explained that the fact that he hadnt been neutered was a good clue about his age Male and female cats tend to become sexually mature at around six months of age If they are left entire after that they go through some distinct physical changes For instance toms get fuller in the face particularly around the cheeks They also develop thicker skins and generally become quite big certainly bigger than those cats that have been neutered she told me Hes not that big so Id guess that hes maybe nine to ten months old she said As she passed me the release forms she explained that there was a minor risk of complications but that it was a really tiny chanceWe will give him a thorough examination and maybe run a blood test before we go ahead with it she said If theres a problem we will contact you OK I said looking slightly sheepish I didnt have a working mobile so they would have trouble contacting me She then took me through the procedure itselfThe operation happens under general anaesthetic and is usually pretty straightforward The testicles are removed through two small incisions made into the scrotal sacs Ouch Bob I said giving him a playful ruffle If everything goes OK you can come and collect Bob in six hours she said looking down at her watch So at around four thirty Is that OK Yeah great I nodded See you then After giving Bob a final cuddle I headed back out into the overcast streets There was rain brewing once more I didnt have time to head all the way into central London By the time Id set up and sung a few songs it would be time to turn around again So I decided to take my chances around the nearest railway station Dalston Kingsland It wasnt the greatest pitch in the world but it provided me with afew quid and a place to while away the hours as I waited for Bob There was also a very friendly cobblers shop next to the station where I knew I would get shelter from the inevitable rain when it came I tried to block Bob out of my thoughts as I played I didnt want to think about him in the operating theatre He had probably lived his life on the street and could well have had all sorts of other things wrong Id heard stories of cats and dogs going into vets surgeries for the most minor procedures and never coming out again I struggled to keep my darkest thoughts at bay It didnt help that there were big black clouds glowering over me Time passed very very slowly Eventually however the clock reached 415pm and I began packing up I almost ran the last few hundred yards to the clinic The nurse Id seen earlier was at the reception desk talking to a colleague and greeted me with a warm smile How is he Did it all go all right I asked still breathing heavily Hes fine absolutely fine Dont worry she said Get your breath back and Ill take you through It was weird I hadnt felt this concerned about someone or something for years I went into the surgical area and saw Bob lying in a nice warm cage Hello Bob mate how you doing I said He was still very dopey and drowsy so didnt recognise me for a while but when he did he sat upright and started clawing at the doors of the cage as if to say Let me outta here The nurse got me to sign a discharge notice and then gave Bob a good once over to make sure he was fit to leave She was really lovely and very helpful which made a pleasant change after the previous experience Id had at the vets She showed me where the incisions had been made It will stay swollen and sore around there for a couple of days but thats normal she said Just check every now and again to make sure theres no discharge or anything like that If you notice that then give us a ring or bring him back in so we can check him out Im sure hell be fine How long will he be groggy I asked her Could be a couple of days before hes back to his normal brighteyed and bushytailed self she said It varies a lot some cats bounce back immediately With others it kind of knocks the stuffing out of them for a couple of days But they are normally as right as rain within fortyeighthours He probably wont want to eat much the day after but his appetite will return fairly soon But if he stays very sleepy and lethargic give us a ring or bring him in for a checkup Its very rare but cats sometimes get infections from the operation she said Id brought the recycling box along with me again and was just about to pick Bob up to pick him up when she told me to wait Hang on she said I think we can do better than that She went away for a couple of minutes and then produced a lovely skyblue carrying case Oh thats not mine I said Oh dont worry its OK Weve got loads of spares you can have this one Just drop it back in when youre next passing Really I had no idea how it had got there Maybe someone had left it behind Or maybe someone had brought their cat in and returned to discover that it would not be needed any more I didnt want to dwell on it too much It was obvious that the op had taken a lot out of Bob In the carrier on the way home he just lay there half asleep The moment we got into the flat he slowly padded over to his favourite spot by the radiator and lay down He slept there all night I took the day off work the next day to make sure he was OK The advice from the vet was that he should be supervised for twentyfour to fortyeight hours after the operation to make sure there werent any side effects I was to particularly look out for continuing drowsiness which wasnt a good sign It was approaching the end of the week so I knew Id need some money But I could never have forgiven myself if something had gone wrong so I stayed in the flat on twentyfourhour Bob watch Fortunately he was absolutely fine The following morning he was a bit perkier and ate a little bit of breakfast As the nurse had predicted he didnt have his normal appetite but he ate half a bowl of his favourite food which was encouraging He also wandered around the flat a little bit although again he wasnt his normal ebullient self Over the next couple of days he began becoming more like the old Bob Within three days of the op he was wolfing down his food just like before I could tell he was still in the occasional bit of pain He would wince or come to a sudden stop every now and again but it wasnt a major problem I knew that hed still have the odd mad halfhour but I was glad Id acted Chapter 4 Ticket to Ride As the fortnight drew to a close I realised that I had to think about getting Bob out of the flat and back on to the streets Thats where he had come from and I assumed thats where he would want to return Hed continued to make really good progress and looked much healthier than he had done when I first met him Hed fattened up a lot more too So a day or two after Id completed the course of medicine and hed recovered fully from his op I took Bob downstairs and out through the hallway I led him down the path and out towards the gate then pointed him in the direction of the street He just stood there fixed to the spot looking at me confused as if to sayWhat do you want me to do Go go go on I said making sweeping movements with my hands It had no effect whatsoever For a moment I just stood there engaged in a miniature staring competition with him But then he just turned on his heels and padded off not in the direction of the street but towards the patch of ground where he liked to do his business He then dug a hole covered it all up and strolled back towards me This time his expression saidOK I did what you wanted What now It was then that for the first time a thought began to crystallise in my head I think you want to hang around I said quietly to him Part of me was pleased I enjoyed his company and he was certainly a character But being sensible about it I knew I shouldnt let it happen I was still struggling to look after myself I was still on a drug dependency programme and would be for the foreseeable future How on earth was I going to look after a cat even one as intelligent and selfsufficient as Bob It wasnt fair on either of us So with a heavy heart I decided that Id have to slowly start easing him out of the flat during the day When I went to work in the morning I would no longer leave him in the flat Id take him out with me then leave him outside in the gardens Tough love I told myself He didnt like it one bit The first time I did it he shot me a look that saidtraitor As I headed off with my guitar over my shoulder he followed quietly stalking me zigzagging across the pavement like some spy trying to remain unseen Except it was easy to spot his distinctive ginger fur bobbing and weaving around Each time I saw him Id stop and wave my arms flamboyantly waving him back Hed limp away reluctantly throwing me a few betrayed looks as he went Eventually hed get the message and disappear When I got back six or so hours later he would be waiting for me at the entrance to the flats Part of me wanted to prevent him from coming in But that part was overwhelmed by the one that wanted to invite him up to the flat once more to curl up at my feet Over the course of the next few days the pair of us settled into a bit of a routine Each day Id leave him outside and each night when I got back from busking Id find him waiting for me either outside in an alleyway or if someone had let him in during the day sitting on the mat outside my flat He wasnt going away that was obvious I decided I had to take the ultimate step and leave him out overnight The first night I did it I saw him lurking in the area where the bins were kept I tried to sneak in without him seeing me It was a stupid move He was a cat he had more senses in one of his whiskers than I had in my entire body No sooner had I opened the door to the building than he was there squeezing his way in I left him outside in the hallway that night but he was on my doormat when I emerged again in the morning For the next few days we went through the same performance Each day I stepped outside hed either be hanging around the hallway or would be waiting outside Each night hed find a way of getting into the building Eventually he decided that hed won that particular battle So I was soon dealing with another problem He began following me down the main road The first time he came as far as the main road but returned to the block when I shooed him away The next time he tailed me for a hundred yards or so down the road towards Tottenham High Road where I got the bus to Covent Garden A part of me admired his tenacity and sheer perseverance But another part of me was cursing him I simply couldnt shake him off Each day after that he got further and further becoming bolder and bolder Part of me wondered whether one day after I left him hed actually keep going and find somewhere else to go But each night I got home there he was waiting I knew that something had to give eventually though And it did One day I headed out for work as usual I had packed my large black acoustic guitar with its red trim on the edge of the body slung it over my shoulder along with my rucksack and headed downstairs I saw Bob was sitting in an alleyway and said hello When he started to follow me I shooed him away as usual Stay there you cant come where Im going I said This time he seemed to get the message and slunk off As I headed down the road I looked back occasionally to see if he was there but there was no sign of himPerhaps hes finally getting the message I said to myself To get to the bus stop that would take me to Covent Garden I had to cross Tottenham High Road one of the busiest and most dangerous roads in north London This morning as usual cars lorries and motorbikes were carving their way along the road trying to pick their way through the clogged traffic As I stood on the pavement trying to spot a gap so that I could run for the bus that was looming into view a hundred yards or so down the trafficpacked street I felt someone or something rub against my leg Instinctively I looked down I saw a familiar figure standing alongside me To my horror I could see that Bob was going through the same process as me looking for his opportunity to cross What the hell are you doing here I said to him He just looked at me dismissively as if Id just asked a really stupid question Then he focused once more on the road nudging himself nearer the edge of the kerb as if getting ready to make a dash for it I couldnt let him risk it It would almost certainly be suicide So I swept him up and put him on my shoulder where I knew he liked to sit He sat there snuggled up against the side of my head as I sidestepped and weaved my way through the traffic and crossed the road All right Bob thats far enough I said to him as I put him down on the pavement and shooed him away again He sidled off down the street into the throngMaybe now Ive seen the last of him I thought to myself He really was a long way from home now A few moments later the bus pulled up It was an oldfashioned red doubledecker bus that you could jump on at the back I went to sit on the bench at the back of the bus and was placing my guitar case in the storage space near where the conductor was standing when behind me I saw a sudden flash of ginger fur Before I knew it Bob had jumped up and plonked himself on the seat next to where I was sitting I was gobsmacked I realised finally that I wasnt ever going to shake this cat off But then I realised something else I invited Bob to jump on my lap which he did in the blink of an eye A moment or two later the conductor appeared She was a cheerful West Indian lady and smiled at Bob then me Is he yours she said stroking him I guess he must be I said Chapter 5 Centre of Attention For the next fortyfive minutes or so Bob sat quietly next to me his face pressed against the glass of the bus window watching the world go by He seemed to be fascinated by all the cars cyclists vans and pedestrians whizzing past us he wasnt fazed at all The only time he pulled away from the window and looked to me for a little reassurance was when the blare of a police siren a fire engine or an ambulance got a bit too close for comfort This surprised me a bit and once more set me thinking about where he had spent his early life If he had grown up on the streets he would have got used to this noise a long long time ago Nothing to worry about I told him each time giving him a friendly stroke on the back of the neck This is what the middle of London sounds like Bob better get used to it It was odd even though I knew he was a street cat and could run away at any time I had this deepseated feeling that he was here in my life to stay Somehow I sensed this wouldnt be the last time wed make this trip together I was going to get off at my usual bus stop near Tottenham Court Road tube station As it loomed into view I picked up my guitar scooped up Bob and headed for the exit On the pavement I fished around in my coat pocket and found the makeshift shoelace lead that Id left in there after taking Bob out to do his business the evening before I put it around his neck then placed him down I didnt want him wandering off The junction of Tottenham Court Road and New Oxford Street was bustling with shoppers tourists and ordinary Londoners getting on with their day Hed have been lost in a second or even worse crushed by one of the buses or black cabs whistling towards and from Oxford Street Understandably it was all a bit intimidating for Bob It was unfamiliar territory for him well I assumed it was I couldnt be sure of course As we picked our way along I could tell from his slightly uptight body language and the way he kept looking up at me that he was uneasy So I decided to take one of my normal short cuts through the back streets to get to Covent Garden Come on Bob lets get you out of the crowds I said Even then he wasnt 100 per cent happy Weaving our way through the throng he kept shooting me looks as if to say he wasnt quite sure about this After only a few yards I could tell that he wanted me to pick him up All right but dont make a habit of it I said gathering him up and placing him on my shoulders just as Id done crossing Tottenham High Road Hed soon settled into a comfortable spot at a slight angle across my right shoulder blade with his front paws placed on the top of my arm looking out like the occupant of the birds nest on some pirate ship I couldnt help smiling inwardly I must look a bit like Long John Silver except I had a puss rather than a parrot sailing along with me He certainly seemed to be very comfortable there I could feel him purring lightly as we walked through the throng across New Oxford Street and into the smaller streets leading down towards Covent Garden The crowds had thinned out by now and after a while I began to forget Bob was there Instead I started to immerse myself in the usual thoughts that went through my mind on the way to work Was the weather going to be good enough for me to get a solid five hours busking Answer Probably It was overcast but the clouds were white and high in the sky There wasnt much chance of rain What sort of crowd would there be in Covent Garden Well it was getting close to Easter so there were a lot of tourists How long would it take me to make the twenty or thirty pounds I needed to get me and now Bob through the next few days Well it had taken me the best part of five hours the previous day Maybe it would be better today maybe it wouldnt That was the thing with busking you just never knew I was mulling all these things over still when I was suddenly aware of something Ordinarily no one would engage or even exchange a look with me I was a busker and this was London I didnt exist I was a person to be avoided shunned even But as I walked down Neal Street that afternoon almost every person we passed was looking at me Well more to the point they were looking at Bob One or two had quizzical slightly confused looks on their faces which was understandable I guess It must have looked slightly incongruous a tall longhaired bloke walking along with a large ginger tom on his shoulders Not something you see every day even on the streets of London Most people however were reacting more warmly The moment they saw Bob their faces would break into broad smiles It wasnt long before people were stopping us Ah look at you two said one welldressed middleaged lady laden down with shopping bags Hes gorgeous Can I stroke him Of course I said thinking it would be a oneoff event She plonked down her bags and placed her face right up to his What a lovely fellow you are arent you she said He is a boy isnt he He is I said Isnt he good to sit there on your shoulders like that Dont see that very often He must really trust you Id barely said goodbye to the lady when we were approached by two young girls Theyd seen the lady making a fuss of Bob so I guess they thought they could do the same They turned out to be Swedish teenagers on holiday What is his name Can we take his picture they said snapping away with their cameras the instant I nodded His names Bob I said Ah Bob Cool We chatted for a minute or two One of them had a cat herself and produced a picture of it for me I had to politely excuse myself after a couple of minutes otherwise they would have spent hours drooling over him We carried on towards the bottom of Neal Street in the direction of Long Acre But the going was slow No sooner had the latest admirer gone away than the same thing was happening again and again Id barely go three feet without being stopped by someone who wanted to stroke or talk to Bob The novelty soon wore off At this rate I wasnt going to get anywhere I began to realise It normally took me not much more than ten minutes to get from my normal bus stop to my pitch at Covent Garden But it had already taken me twice that because everyone had seemed to want to stop and talk to Bob It was a bit ridiculous By the time we got to Covent Garden it was almost an hour after I normally got set up Thanks a lot Bob youve probably cost me a few quid in lost earnings I heard myself saying in my head halfjokingly It was a serious issue though If he was going to slow me down this much every day I really couldnt let him follow me on to the bus again I thought It wasnt long before I was thinking a bit differently By this point Id been busking around Covent Garden for about a year and a half I generally started at about two or three in the afternoon and carried on until around eight in the evening It was the best time to capture tourists and people finishing off their shopping or on the way home from work At the weekends I would go earlier and do lunchtimes On Thursday Friday and Saturday Id carry on until quite late trying to take advantage of the extra numbers of Londoners that hung around at the end of the working week Id learned to be flexible in finding an audience My main pitch was on a patch of pavement directly outside Covent Garden tube station on James Street Id work that until about 630pm when the main evening rush hour was at its peak Then for the last couple of hours Id walk around all the pubs in Covent Garden where people were standing outside smoking and drinking In the summer months this could be quite productive as office workers unwound after their days work with a pint and a fag in the evening sunshine It could be a bit risky at times Some people took exception to me approaching them and could be rude and even abusive at timesPiss off you scrounger Get yourself a proper job you lazy f That kind of stuff But that came with the territory I was used to it There were plenty of people who were happy to hear me play a song then slip me a quid Busking at James Street was a bit of a gamble as well Technically speaking I wasnt supposed to be there The Covent Garden area is divided up very specifically into areas when it comes to street people Its regulated by officials from the local council an officious bunch that we referred to as Covent Guardians My pitch should have been on the eastern side of Covent Garden near the Royal Opera House and Bow Street Thats where the musicians were supposed to operate according to the Covent Guardians The other side of the piazza the western side was where the street performers were supposed to ply their trade The jugglers and entertainers generally pitched themselves under the balcony of the Punch and Judy pub where they usually found a rowdy audience willing to watch them James Street where I had begun playing was meant to be the domain of the human statues There were a few of them around one guy dressed as Charlie Chaplin used to do quite well but only worked now and again But it was normally clear so I had taken advantage and made it my own little patch I knew there was always the risk of getting moved along by the Covent Guardians but I took my chances and it usually paid off The volume of people coming out of the tube station there was huge If only one in a thousand of them made adrop then I could do OK It was just after 3pm when I got to my pitch finally Just as we turned into James Street we were stopped for the umpteenth time on this occasion by an obviously gay guy on his way home from the gym judging by the sweaty kit he was wearing He made a complete fuss of Bob and even asked me I think jokingly whether he could buy him off me No mate hes not for sale I said politely just in case he was serious Walking away from the guy I just looked at Bob and shook my head Only in London mate only in London Arriving at the pitch I firstly checked to make sure the coast was clear There was no sign of the Covent Guardians There were also a couple of people who worked at the tube station who sometimes gave me some hassle because they knew I wasnt supposed to be there But they didnt seem to be around either So I put Bob down on the pavement near the wall unzipped my guitar case took off my jacket and got ready to tune up Ordinarily it would take me a good ten minutes to get tuned start playing and get people to pay me some attention Today though a couple of people slowed down in front of me and lobbed small denomination coins into my guitar case even before Id played a noteGenerous of them I thought It was as I fiddled around tuning my guitar that the penny eventually dropped My back was turned to the crowd when I again heard the distinctive clinking of one coin hitting another Behind me I heard a male voiceNice cat mate he said I turned and saw an ordinarylooking guy in his midtwenties giving me a thumbs up sign and walking off with a smile on his face I was taken aback Bob had curled himself up in a comfortable ball in the middle of the empty guitar case I knew he was a charmer But this was something else Id taught myself to play the guitar when I was a teenager living back in Australia People would show me things and then Id work my way through them on my own I got my first guitar when I was fifteen or sixteen It was quite late to start playing I suppose I bought an old electric guitar from a Cash Converters in Melbourne Id always played on my friends acoustic guitars but I fancied an electric one I loved Jimi Hendrix I thought he was fantastic and wanted to play like him The set Id put together for my busking featured some of the things that Id enjoyed playing for years Kurt Cobain had always been a bit of a hero of mine so there was some Nirvana in there But I also played some Bob Dylan and a fair bit by Johnny Cash One of the most popular things I played was Hurt originally by Nine Inch Nails but then covered by Johnny Cash It was easier to play that version because it was an acoustic piece I also played The Man In Black by Johnny Cash That was a good busking song and it was kind of appropriate too I generally wore black The most popular song in my set was Wonderwall by Oasis That always worked best especially outside the pubs when I wandered around later in the evenings I played pretty much the same stuff over and over every day It was what people liked Thats what the tourists wanted to hear I would usually start with a song like About A Girl by Nirvana just to get the fingers going Thats what I did today as Bob sat in front of me watching the crowds walk out of the tube station Id barely been playing for more than a few minutes when a group of kids stopped They were obviously from Brazil and were all wearing Brazilian football shirts and speaking what I recognised as Portuguese One of them a young girl bent down and began stroking Bob Ahgato bonita she said She is saying you have a beautiful cat one of the boys said helpfully translating her Portuguese They were just kids on a trip to London but they were fascinated Almost immediately other people were stopping to see what the fuss was about About half a dozen of the Brazilian kids and other passersby began fishing around in their pockets and started raining coins into the bag Looks like you may not be such a bad companion after all Bob Ill invite you out for the day more often I smiled at him Id not planned on bringing him along with me so I didnt have much to give him There was a halfempty packet of his favourite cat treats in my rucksack so I gave him one of them every now and again Like me hed have to wait until later to get a decent meal As the late afternoon turned into the early evening and the crowds thickened with people heading home from work or out into the West End for the evening more and more people were slowing down and looking at Bob There was clearly something about him that fascinated people As darkness was beginning to descend one middleaged lady stopped for a chat How long have you had him she asked bending down to stroke Bob Oh only a few weeks I said We sort of found each other Found each other Sounds interesting At first I was a bit suspicious I wondered whether she was some kind of animal welfare person and might tell me that I had no right to keep him or something But she turned out simply to be a real cat lover She smiled as I explained the story of how wed met and how Id spent a fortnight nursing him back to health I had a ginger tom very much like this one a few years ago she said looking a bit emotional For a moment I thought she was going to burst into tears You are lucky to have found him They are just the best companions they are so quiet and docile Youve found yourself a real friend there she said I think you are right I smiled She placed a fiver into the guitar case before leaving He was definitely a lady puller I realised I estimated that something like 70 per cent of the people who had stopped so far had been females After just over an hour I had as much as what Id normally make in a good day just over twentyfive pounds This is brilliant I thought to myself But something inside me was saying that I shouldnt call it quits that I should carry on for tonight The truth was I was still torn about Bob Despite the gut feeling I had that this cat and I were somehow destined to be together a large part of me still figured that hed eventually go off and make his own way It was only logical Hed wandered into my life and he was going to wander back out again at some point This couldnt carry on So as the passersby continued to slow down and make a fuss of him I figured I might as well make the most of it Make hay while the sun shines and all that If he wants to come out and have fun with me thats great I said to myself And Im making a bit of cash as well then thats great too Except that it was more than just a bit of cash by now I had been used to making around twenty pounds a day which was enough to get me through a few days and to cover all the expenses of running my flat But that night by the time I finished up at around 8pm it was clear that Id made a lot more than that After packing up my guitar it took me all of five minutes to count out all the coins that had piled up There were what looked like hundreds of coins of all denominations as well as a few notes scattered amongst them When I finally totted it all up I shook my head quietly I had made the princely sum of£6377 To most of the people walking around Covent Garden that might not have seemed like a lot of money But it was to me I transferred all the coins into my rucksack and hauled it on to my shoulders It was rattling like a giant piggy bank It also weighed a ton But I was ecstatic That was the most Id ever made in a days work on the streets three times what Id make on a normal day I picked up Bob giving him a stroke on the back of the neck Well done mate I said That was what I call a good evenings work I decided that I didnt need to wander around the pubs Besides I knew Bob was hungry as was I We needed to head home I walked back towards Tottenham Court Road and the bus stop with Bob once more positioned on my shoulder I wasnt rude to anyone but I decided not to engage with absolutely everyone who stopped and smiled at us I couldnt There were too many of them I wanted to get home this side of midnight Well have something nice to eat tonight Bob I said as we settled on to the bus for the trip back up to Tottenham Again he pinned his nose up against the window watching the bright lights and the traffic I got off the bus near a really nice Indian restaurant on Tottenham High Road Id walked past it many times savouring the lengthy menu but never had enough spare money to be able to afford anything Id always had to make do with something from a cheaper place nearer to the block of flats I went in and ordered a chicken tikka masala with lemon rice a peshwari naan and a sag paneer The waiters threw me a few funny looks when they saw Bob on a lead beside me So I said Id pop back in twenty minutes and headed off with Bob to a supermarket across the road With the money wed made I treated Bob to a nice pouch of posh cat food a couple of packs of his favourite nibbles and some cat milk I also treated myself to a couple of nice tins of lager Lets push the boat out Bob I said to him Its been a day to remember After picking up our dinner I almost ran home I was so overwhelmed by the tempting smells coming out from the brown paper carrier bag from the upmarket curry house When we got inside Bob and I both wolfed down our food as if there was no tomorrow I hadnt eaten so well in months well maybe years Im pretty sure he hadnt either We then curled up for a couple of hours me watching television and him snuggled up in his favourite spot under the radiator We both slept like logs that night Chapter 6 One Man and His Cat The next morning I was woken by a sudden loud crashing sound It took me a moment to get my bearings but when I did so I immediately guessed what it was The metallic clanging noise had come from the kitchen That probably meant that once again Bob was trying to open the cupboards where I kept his food and had knocked something over I squinted at the clock It was midmorning After the excitement of the previous night I had given myself a lie in but Bob had obviously decided he couldnt wait any longer This was his way of saying Get up I want my breakfast I hauled myself out of bed and stumbled into the kitchen The small tin saucepan I used to boil milk was lying on the floor As soon as he saw me Bob slid his way purposefully towards his bowl OK mate I get the picture I said unlocking the cupboards and reaching for a sachet of his favourite chicken dish I spooned a couple of portions into the bowl and watched him devour it in seconds He then gulped down the water in his bowl licked his face and paws clean and trotted off into the living room where looking very satisfied with himself he took his favourite position under the radiator If only all our lives were that simple I thought to myself Id considered not going to work but then thought better of it We may have had a lucky break last night but that money wouldnt keep us going for long The electricity and gas bills were due soon Given the cold weather wed had in recent months they werent going to make for pleasant reading It had also begun to dawn on me that I had a new responsibility in my life I had an extra mouth to feed a rather hungry and manipulative one So after wolfing down some breakfast of my own I started getting my stuff together I wasnt sure whether Bob would want to come out busking with me again today Yesterday might have been a oneoff he might simply have been satisfying his curiosity about where I went when I left home most days But I put some snacks in the bag for him just in case he did decide to follow me again It was early afternoon as I headed off It was obvious what I was doing I had my rucksack and guitar lashed across my back If he didnt want to go out of the flat with me which was rare he generally let me know by slinking off behind the sofa For a moment I thought that was what he was going to do today When I took the chain off the front door he headed in that direction But then as I was about to shut the door behind mehe bolted towards me and followed me out into the corridor and towards the staircase When we got to the ground floor and out into the open air he scurried off into the bushes to do his business Afterwards rather than heading to me he trotted off towards the area where the bins were kept The bins were becoming more and more of a fascination for him Goodness knows what he was finding and eating in there I thought that this might be the only reason hed wanted to come down with me I wasnt too happy about him rooting around in the rubbish so went to check what was there You never knew when the local bin men would come Fortunately there must have been a collection earlier that morning because there was no stray rubbish around There were slim pickings Bob wasnt going to have much joy Reassured I decided to head off without him I knew hed get back inside the building somehow especially now that a lot of the neighbours knew him One or two had started making a real fuss of him whenever they saw him One lady who lived on the floor below me always gave him a treat He would probably be waiting on the landing for me when I got home that evening Fair enough I thought as I set off for Tottenham High Road Bob had done me a huge favour the previous day I wasnt going to exploit our relationship by demanding he come along with me every day He was my companion not my employee The skies were grey and there was a hint of rain in the air If it was like this in central London it was going to be a waste of time Busking on a rainy day was never a good idea Instead of feeling sympathy for you people simply rushed by that bit quicker If it was bucketing down in the centre of town I told myself Id simply turn around and head back home I would rather spend the day hanging out with Bob I wanted to use the money wed made the previous night to get him a decent lead and collar I was about two hundred yards or so down the road when I sensed something behind me I turned round and saw a familiar figure padding along the pavement Ah changed our mind have we I said as he approached me Bob tilted his head ever so slightly to one side and gave me one of those pitying looks as if to saywell why else would I be standing here I still had the shoestring lead in my pocket I put it on and we started walking down the road together The streets of Tottenham are very different to those of Covent Garden but just like the day before people immediately began staring at us And just like the day before one or two looked at me disapprovingly They clearly thought I was off my rocker leading a ginger tom around on a piece of string If this is going to become a regular thing I really am going to have to get you a proper lead I said quietly to Bob suddenly feeling a bit selfconscious But for every person that gave me a dirty look another half dozen smiled and nodded at me One West Indian lady weighed down with bags of shopping gave us a big sunny grin Dont you two make a pretty picture she said No one had engaged me in conversation on the streets around my flat in all the months Id lived here It was odd but also amazing It was as if my Harry Potter invisibility cloak had slipped off my shoulders When we got to the crossing point at Tottenham High Road Bob gave me a look as if to sayCome on you know what to do now and I plonked him on my shoulders Soon we were on the bus with Bob taking his favourite position with his head pressed against the glass We were on the road again Id been right about the weather Soon the rain was hammering down forming intricate patterns on the window where Bob had once more pressed his face tight against the glass Outside you could just make out a sea of umbrellas There were people running splashing through the streets to avoid the downpour Thankfully the rain had eased off by the time we reached the centre of town Despite the weather there were even bigger crowds in the centre of town than there had been the previous day Well give it a go for a couple of hours I said to Bob as I plonked him on my shoulders and headed off towards Covent Garden But if it starts to rain again well head back I promise Walking down Neal Street once again people were stopping us all the time I was happy to let them fuss over Bob within reason In the space of ten minutes half a dozen people had stopped us and at least half of them had asked to take a picture I quickly learned that the key was to keep moving otherwise youd be surrounded before you knew it It was as we were reaching the end of Neal Street near where I turned towards James Street that something interesting happened I suddenly felt Bobs paws readjusting themselves on my shoulder Before I knew it he was sliding off my shoulder and clambering down my arm When I let him hop on to the pavement he began walking ahead of me I extended the lead to its full length and let him go It was obvious that he recognised where we were andwas going to take it from here He was leading the way He marched ahead of me all the way to the pitch where wed been the previous night He then stood there waiting for me to take out my guitar and lay the guitar case down for him There you go Bob I said He instantly sat down on the soft case as if it was where he belonged He positioned himself so that he could watch the world walk by which this being Covent Garden it was There had been a time when Id had ambitions of making it as a real musician Id harboured dreams of becoming the next Kurt Cobain As naive and completely stupid as it sounds now it had been part of my grand plan when Id come back to England from Australia Thats what Id told my mother and everyone else when Id set off Id had my moments and for a brief time I felt like I might actually get somewhere It was hard for a while but things changed around 2002 when Id got off the streets and into some sheltered accommodation in Dalston One thing had led to another and Id formed a band with some guys Id met We were a fourpiece guitar band called Hyper Fury which told you a lot about my and my band mates state of mind at the time The name certainly summed me up I was an angry young man I really was hyperfurious about life in general and about feeling that Id not had a fair break in particular My music was an outlet for my anger and angst For that reason we werent very mainstream Our songs were edgy and dark and our lyrics even more so which was hardly surprising I suppose given that our influences were bands like Nine Inch Nails and Nirvana We actually managed to put out two albums though EPs might be a more accurate description The first came out in September 2003 with another band Corrision It was calledCorrision v Hyper Furyand featured two pretty heavy tracks calledOnslaught and Retaliator Again the titles offer a fairly strong indication to our musical philosophy We followed that up six months later in March 2004 with a second album calledProfound Destruction Unit which featured three songsSorry Profound and another version of Retaliator It sold a few copies but it didnt really set the world on fire Put it this way we didnt get booked for Glastonbury We did have some fans though and managed to get some gigs mainly in north London and places like Camden in particular There was a big Gothy kind of scene going on there and we fitted in well with it We looked and certainly sounded the part We did gigs in pubs we played at squat parties basically we played wherever we were invited There was a moment when we might have started to make progress The biggest gig we did was at The Dublin Castle a famous music pub in north London where we played a couple of times In particular we played in the Gothic Summer festival there which was quite a big deal at the time Things were going so well for us at one point that I teamed up with a guy called Pete from Corrision and started our own independent label Corrupt Drive Records But it didnt really work or to be more accurate I didnt really work At the time my best friend Belle and I were in what would be a brief relationship together We got on great as friends She is a really caring person and looked after me but as a relationship it was kind of doomed from the beginning The problem was that she was on drugs as well and she was codependent It really didnt help me or her as we struggled to kick our habits When one of us was trying to get clean the other one was using and vice versa Thats codependency all over So it made it really difficult for me to break the cycle I was trying to break the cycle but looking back on it if Im honest I wouldnt say I was trying hard I think part of it was that I didnt really feel like it was ever going to become a reality Mentally at least the band was something I put on the backburner It was too easy to slip back into old habits quite literally By 2005 Id accepted that the band was a hobby not a way of making a living Pete carried on with the record label and still runs it now I believe But I was struggling so badly with my habit that I fell by the wayside again It became another one of those second chances that I let slip through my fingers I guess Ill never know what might have been Id never given up on music however Even when the band broke up and it was clear that I wasnt going to get anywhere professionally I would spend hours most days playing on the guitar improvising songs It was a great outlet for me God knows where Id have been without it And busking hadcertainly made a difference to my life in recent years Without it and the money it generated I dread to think what I would have ended up doing to earn cash That really didnt bear thinking about That evening as I settled down into the session the tourists were once more out in force It was a repeat of the previous day The moment I sat down or more precisely the moment Bob sat down people who would normally have rushed by began to slow down and interact with him Again it was women rather than men who showed the most interest Not long after Id started playing a rather stonyfaced traffic warden walked past I saw her look down at Bob and watched as her face melted into a warm smile Aah look at you she said stopping and kneeling down to stroke Bob She barely gave me a second glance and didnt drop anything into the guitar case But that was fine I was beginning to love the way that Bob seemed to be able to brighten up peoples days He was a beautiful creature there was no doubt about that But it wasnt just that There was something else about Bob It was his personality that was attracting the attention People could sense something about him I could sense it myself There was something special about him He had an unusual rapport with people well people he knew had his best interests at heart at least Every now and again Id see him bridle a bit when he saw someone he didnt like As we settled down a very smart richlooking MiddleEastern guy walked past arminarm with a really attractive blonde She could easily have been a model Oh look What a gorgeous cat she said suddenly stopping in her tracks and pulling on the guys arm to slow him down The guy looked distinctly unimpressed and flicked his hand dismissively as if to say So what The instant he did so Bobs body language changed He arched his back ever so slightly and shifted his body position so that he was a few inches closer to me It was subtle but to me it was really telling I wonder whether this guy reminds Bob of someone from his pastI thought to myself as the couple walked onI wonder whether he had seen that look before Id have given anything to know his story discover what had led him to the hallway of my block of flats that evening But that was something I never was going to know It would always be guesswork As I settled into my set I was much more relaxed than twentyfour hours earlier I think having Bob there the previous day had thrown me a bit psychologically Id been used to having to engage and draw in the crowds myself It had been hard work Eking out every penny was tough With Bob it was different The way hed sucked in the audience for me had been a bit odd at first Id also felt very responsible for him with so many people around Covent Garden like the rest of London has its share of weirdoes I was terrified that someone would just grab him and run off with him But that day felt different however That day I felt like we were safe like we kind of belonged here As I began singing and the coins started tinkling into the case at the same rate as the previous day I thought to myselfIm enjoying this It had been a long time since Id said that By the time we headed home three hours later my rucksack was once more jangling with the weight of coins Wed collected well over sixty pounds again This time I wasnt going to spend it on an expensive curry I had more practical uses for the money The following day the weather was even worse with the forecast of really heavy rain that night So I decided to spend some time on Bob rather than busking If he was going to hang out with me on a regular basis then I needed to have better equipment for him I couldnt walk around with him attached to a leash made out of a shoelace Apart from anything else it was uncomfortable not to mention dangerous Bob and I hopped on a bus and headed off in the direction of Archway I knew the north London branch of the Cats Protection charity was there Bob seemed to sense immediately that this wasnt the same route wed taken the previous couple of days Every now and again he would turn and look at me as if to say So where are you taking me today He wasnt anxious just curious The Cats Protection shop was a smart modern place with all sorts of equipment toys and books about cats There were loads of free pamphlets and brochures on every aspect of caring for a cat from microchipping to toxoplasmosis diet tips to neutering advice I picked up a few for future reading There were only a couple of people working there and the place was quiet So they couldnt resist coming over for a chat as I took a look around with Bob sitting on my shoulder Hes a goodlooking boy isnt he one lady said stroking Bob He could tell he was in safe hands because he was leaning his body into her as she smoothed his coat and cooed over him We then fell into a conversation about how Bob and I had met I then explained what had happened the previous two days Both women smiled and nodded A lot of cats like to go out for a walk with their owners one told me They like to go for a walk in the park or for a short stroll down the street But I have to say Bobs a bit unusual isnt he He is her friend said I think youve got yourself a bit of a jewel there Hes obviously decided to attach himself to you It was nice to hear them confirming what deep down I knew already Every now and again I had a little pang of doubt about whether I should try harder to put him back on the streets whether I was doing the right thing in keeping him in the flat with me Their words were a real boost for me What I didnt know however was how best to manage Bob if he was going to be my constant companion on the streets of London It wasnt the safest of environments to put it mildly Apart from the obvious traffic there were all sorts of potential threats and dangers out there The best thing you can do is to get a harness like this one of the ladies said unhooking a nicelooking blue woven nylon harness collar and matching lead She explained the pros and cons of it Its not a great idea just to fix a leash to a cat collar The worst collars can harm your cats neck and even choke the cat And the problem with the better quality collars is that they are made from elastic or are what they call breakaway collars so that the cat can escape if the collar gets caught on something Theres a good chance that at some point youll have an empty leash dangling in your hand the lady explained I think you would be much better off with a cat harness and a leash especially given you are out all the time she said Isnt it going to feel funny for him I asked Its not going to feel natural Youll need to ease him into it she agreed It might take you a week or so Start him off wearing it for a few minutes a day before you are ready to go outside together Then build it up from there She could see me mulling it over Why not try it on him Why not I said Bob was sitting comfortably and didnt offer too much resistance although I could tell that he was uncertain about what was happening Just leave it on him and let him get used to the sensation of having it on his body the lady said The harness lead and collar cost about thirteen pounds It was one of the most expensive they had but I figured he was worth it If Id been a businessman chief executive of James Bob Inc Id have been thinking youve got to look after your employees youve got to invest in your human resources except in this case it was my feline resources It only took me a couple of days to introduce Bob to the harness I began just by letting him wear it around the house sometimes with the lead attached At first he was a bit confused at having this extralong leather tail trailing behind him But he soon got used to it Every time he wore it I made sure to praise him for doing so I knew the worst thing I could do was to shout at him not that I ever did that anyway After a couple of days we progressed to going on short walks with it on When we were out busking I stuck to the old collar most of the time but then every now and again Id slip the harness on for a short section of the walk to work Slowly but surely it became second nature to him to have the harness on Bob was still coming with me every day We didnt stay out too long I didnt want to inflict that on him Even though I already had a feeling he would follow me to the ends of the earth and even though he was always sitting on my shoulders and didnt have to walk I wasnt going to do that to him It was during the third week of us busking together that he first decided he didnt want to join me Ordinarily the minute he saw me putting on my coat and packing my rucksack hed be up and moving towards me ready for me to put his lead on But then one day as I went through the normal routine he just shuffled off behind the sofa for a bit then went and laid down underneath the radiator It was as if to say Im having a day off I could tell he was tired Dont fancy it today Bob I said stroking him He looked at me in that knowing way of his No problem I said heading to the kitchen to put some snacks in a bowl to keep him going for the rest of the day until I got home that evening Id read a report once that said leaving the TV on made pets feel less lonely when their owners are out I didnt know whether that was true but I switched the TV set on in any case He immediately shuffled towards his favourite spot and started staring at it Going out that day really brought home to me the difference Bob had made to my life With him on my shoulder or walking on the lead in front of me I turned heads everywhere On my own I was invisible again By now we were well known enough to the locals for a few people to express concern Wheres the cat today one local stallowner said as he passed me by that evening Hes having a day off I said Oh good I was worried something had happened to the little fella he smiled giving me the thumbsup A couple of other people stopped and asked the same question As soon as Id told them Bob was fine they moved on No one was quite as interested in stopping for a talk as they did when Bob was around I may not have liked it but I accepted it Thats the way it was On the pavement at James Street the sound of coins landing in the bag had become music to my ears I couldnt deny that But without Bob I couldnt help noticing that the music slowed down significantly As I played I was conscious that I wasnt making anywhere near as much money It took me a few more hours to earn about half the cash I had made on a good day with Bob It was back to the old daysbefore Bob but that was OK It was as I walked back that evening that something began to sink in It wasnt all about making money I wasnt going to starve And my life was much richer for having Bob in it It was such a pleasure to have such great company such a great companion But somehow it felt like Id been given a chance to get back on track Its not easy when you are working on the streets People dont want to give you a chance Before I had Bob if I would try to approach people in the pubs with my guitar strap on people would go no sorry before Id even had a chance to say hello I could have been asking someone for the time But theyd say to me no change sorry before I opened my mouth That happened all the time They wouldnt even give me the opportunity People dont want to listen All they see is someone they think is trying to get a free ride They dont understand Im working Im not begging I was actually trying to make a living Just because I wasnt wearing a suit and a tie and carrying a briefcase or a computer just because I didnt have a payslip and a P45 it didnt mean that I was freeloading Having Bob there gave me a chance to interact with people They would ask about Bob and I would get a chance to explain my situation at the same time They would ask where he came from and Id then be able to explain how we got together and how we were making money to pay our rent food electricity and gas bills People would give me more of a fair hearing Psychologically people also began to see me in a different light Cats are notoriously picky about who they like And if a cat doesnt like its owner it will go and find another one Cats do that all the time They go and live with somebody else Seeing me with my cat softened me in their eyes It humanised me Especially after Id been so dehumanised In some ways it was giving me back my identity I had been a nonpersonI was becoming a person again Chapter 7 The Two Musketeers Bob wasnt just changing peoples attitude to me he was changing my attitude to others as well Id never really had any responsibilities towards others in my life Id had the odd job here and there when I was younger in Australia and Id also been in a band which required a bit of teamwork But the truth was that since I left home as a teenager my main responsibility had always beento myself Id always had to look after number one simply because there wasnt anyone else to do it As a result my life had become a very selfish one It was all about my daytoday survival Bobs arrival in my life had dramatically changed all that Id suddenly taken on an extra responsibility Another beings health and happiness was down to me It had come as a bit of a shock but I had begun to adapt to it In fact I enjoyed it I knew it may sound silly to a lot of people but for the first time I had an idea what it must be like looking after a child Bob was my baby and making sure he was warm well fed and safe was really rewarding It was scary too I worried about him constantly in particular when I was out on the streets In Covent Garden and elsewhere I was always in protective mode my instincts were always telling me that I had to watch out for him at every turn With good cause I hadnt been lulled into a false sense of security by the way people treated me with Bob The streets of London werent all filled with kindhearted tourists and cat lovers Not everyone was going to react the same way when they saw a longhaired busker and his cat singing for their suppers on street corners It happened less now that I had Bob but I still got a volley of abuse every now and again usually from drunken young blokes who felt the fact they were picking up a pay packet at the end of the week made them somehow superior to me Get off your arse and do a proper days work you longhaired layabout they would say albeit almost always in more colourful language than that I let their insults wash over me I was used to them It was a different matter when people turned their aggression on Bob Thats when my protective instincts really took over Some people saw me and Bob as easy targets Almost every day wed be approached by idiots of some kind They would shout stupid comments or stand there laughing at us Occasionally they would threaten to turn violent One Friday evening quite soon after Bob and I had first come to Covent Garden together I was playing at James Street when a bunch of young very rowdy black lads came past They had real attitude and were obviously on the lookout for trouble A couple of them spotted Bob sitting on the pavement next to me and started makingwoof and meow noises much to the amusement of their mates I could have coped with that It was just stupid puerile stuff But then for no reason whatsoever one of them kicked the guitar case with Bob sitting in it It wasnt a playful tap with his toes it had real venom in it and sent the case and Bob sliding a foot or so along the pavement Bob was really distressed He made a loud noise almost like a scream and jumped out of the case Thankfully his lead was attached to the case otherwise he would almost certainly have run off into the crowds I might never have seen him again Instead restrained by the lead he had no option but to hide behind my rucksack which was standing nearby I got up immediately and confronted the guy What the f did you do that for I said standing toetotoe with him Im quite tall and towered over him but it didnt seem to faze him I just wanted to see if the cat was real he said laughing as if hed cracked a brilliant joke I didnt see the funny side of it Thats really clever you fidiot I said That was the signal for it all to kick off They all began circling me and one of them began shoving into me with his chest and shoulders but I stood my ground and shoved him back For a split second or two there was a standoff but then I pointed to a CCTV camera that I knew was positioned on the corner near us Go on then do what you want But just remember youre on camera see how far you get afterwards The look on their faces was a picture Id love to have captured on CCTV or anywhere They were obviously street smart enough to know you couldnt get away with violence on camera One of them gave me a look as if to say I will get you for that Of course they couldnt back down without raining down another wave of insults But they were soon moving on waving their arms and making every offensive gesture known to man Sticks and stones and all that I wasnt worried In fact I felt good about seeing them off But I didnt hang around much longer that evening I knew their type They didnt take kindly to being dissed The incident proved a couple of things to me First it was always a good idea to be near a CCTV camera It had been another busker who had first given me the advice to always try and pitch yourself near oneYoull be safer there he said Of course I was too much of a knowall back then Wasnt it going to give the authorities evidence if I was busking illegally Id ignored the advice for a while Slowly but surely however Id seen the wisdom of his words and incidents like this underlined them That was the positive The negative was that Id been reminded of something Id also known I really was on my own when trouble flared like this There wasnt a policeman in sight There wasnt a whiff of a Covent Guardian or even any assistance from the staff in the tube station Despite the fact that quite a lot of people were milling around when the gang confronted me none of the passersby offered to intervene In fact people did their best to melt into the background and shuffle off Nobody was going to come to my aid In that respect nothing had changed Except of course I now had Bob As we headed back up to Tottenham that evening he cozied up to me on the busIts you and me against the world I said to him Were the two Musketeers He nuzzled up to me and purred lightly as if in agreement The hard reality was that London was full of people who we had to treat with caution Ever since Id started bringing Bob with me Id been wary of dogs for instance There were a lot of them obviously and it was no surprise that many of them took an instant interest in Bob To be fair in the vast majority of cases people would notice if their dog was getting too close and give them a gentle tug on the lead But others came too close for my comfort Fortunately Bob didnt seem to be bothered about them at all He just ignored them If they came up to him he would just stare them out Again it underlined my suspicion that hed begun his life on the streets hed learned to handle himself there Just how well he could handle himself I found out a week or so after the incident with the gang We were sitting in Neal Street in the late afternoon when a guy with a Staffordshire Bull Terrier loomed into view Arseholes always have Staffs its a fact of London life and this guy really looked like an arsehole He was shavenheaded swigging extrastrength lager and wearing a tatty tracksuit From the way he was slaloming around the street he was off his head already even though it was barely 4pm They slowed down when they got to us purely because the Staff was straining at the leash as it tried to move in the direction of me and Bob As it happened the dog wasnt threatening he was just checking Bob out Well not even that he was checking out the biscuits Bob had in front of him He wasnt eating them at the time so the Staffie started inching his way towards the bowl sniffing excitedly at the prospect of a free titbit or two I couldnt believe what happened next Id seen Bob around dogs a fair bit by now His normal policy was not to give them the time of day On this occasion however he must have felt some action was necessary Hed been snoozing peacefully at my side But as the Staffie leaned in towards the biscuits he calmly looked up picked himself up and then just bopped the dog on the nose with his paw It was so lightning fast it was a punch to do Muhammad Ali proud The dog couldnt believe it He just jumped back in shock and then carried on backtracking I was almost as shocked as the dog I think I just laughed out loud The owner looked at me and then looked down at his dog I think he was so drunk he couldnt fully comprehend what had just happened especially as it had occurred in the blink of an eye He gave the dog a whack around the head then tugged on its lead to move on I think he was embarrassed that his fearsomelooking beast had been made to look stupid by a cat Bob watched quietly as the dog his head hung in shame walked away Within a few seconds hed reverted back to his previous position snoozing at my feet It was as if it was a minor annoyance for him like swatting a pesky fly But for me it was a really revealing moment It told me so much more about my companion and the life he had led before our fateful meeting at the bottom of thestairs He wasnt afraid to defend himself In fact he knew how to look after himself rather well He must have learned to do that somewhere maybe in an environment where there were lots of dogs and aggressive ones at that Once more I found myself fascinated by the same old questions Where had he grown up What adventures had he had before he had joined up with me and become the second Musketeer Living with Bob was fun As our little runin with the Staffie proved there was never a dull moment He was a real personality of that there was no doubt He had all sorts of quirks to his character and I was discovering more and more of them every day By now there was little doubt in my mind that he must have grown up on the streets It wasnt just his streetfighter skills he wasnt really domesticated in any way he was a bit rough around the edges Even now after hed been living with me for the best part of a month he still didnt like using the litter trays Id bought for him He really hated those things and would scamper away whenever I put one down anywhere near him Instead he would hold on until he saw me going out of the door and then do his business downstairs in the gardens of the flats I didnt want it to carry on like this For a start it wasnt much fun walking down and up five flights of stairs to take the cat out whenever he wanted to go to the toilet So I decided to try and give Bob no option but to use the litter trays One day during that third week I said to myself that I would go twentyfour hours without letting him out so that he would have no alternative but to use the litter tray But he won that contest hands down He bottled everything up and waited and waited and waited until I had to go out Then he squeezed past me as I went out the door and bolted down the stairwell to get outside Game set and match to Bob I realised it was a fight I was unlikely to win He also had a wild side to his personality He was calmer than when hed first arrived thanks largely to the fact that hed been neutered But he could still be a complete maniac around the flat and would frequently tear around the place playing with anything that he could lay his paws on One day I watched him amuse himself for the best part of an hour with a bottle top flipping it around the floor of the living room with his paws Another time he found a bumblebee It was obviously injured it had one wing damaged so it was struggling around on the coffee table in the living room The bee was rolling around and every now and again it would fall off the table on to the carpet Every time this happened Bob would very gently pick it up with his teeth and put it back on the table It was really impressive the way he could delicately pick the bee up by the wing and place it safely on the flat surface Hed then watch it while it struggled around again It was a really comical sight He didnt want to eat it He just wanted to play with it The street instinct was still apparent when it came to food as well When I took him downstairs to do his toilet now he made a beeline for the area at the back of the flats where the dustbins were kept The largewheelie bins were often left open and occasionally there were discarded black plastic refuse sacks that had been ripped open by urban foxes or stray dogs Bob would always go and investigate them to see if there were any leftovers On one occasion Id caught him dragging a chicken drumstick that had somehow been overlooked by the other scavengers Old habits die hard I figured It was true of course Despite the fact I was feeding him on a regular basis he still treated every meal as if it was going to be his last At home in the flat the moment I scooped some cat food into his bowl he would stick his face in it and start guzzling as if there was no tomorrow Slow down and enjoy your food Bob Id tell him but to no avail Again I figured hed spent so long having to make the most of every eating opportunity that he hadnt adapted to living in a place where he was guaranteed a square meal twice a day I knew how that felt Id spent large chunks of my life living the same way I couldnt really blame him Bob and I had so much in common Maybe that was why the bond had formed so fast and was growing so deep The most irritating thing literally about him however was the fact that his fur had begun coating every corner of the flat It was perfectly natural of course Spring was here and he was getting rid of his winter coat But he was starting to lose a hell of a lot of fur To help the moulting process he was rubbing himself on anything and everything he could find in the flat As a result he was covering it in a thick film of fur It was a real pain It was a good sign that his coat and the rest of his body was returning to good health He was still a bit scrawny but there was no sign of his ribs as there had been when Id first met him His coat was naturally thin because of the environment hed probably grown up in the street The medication had helped with his bald patches and the antibiotics had definitely done the trick in healing his old wound That had almost disappeared now in fact if you didnt know it was there you would never have noticed it All in all he looked in a lot better nick than he had done a month or so earlier I didnt bathe him Cats wash themselves and he was a typical cat in that respect regularly licking and washing himself In fact Bob was one of the most meticulous cats Id ever seen Id watch him go through the ritual methodically licking his paws It fascinated me especially the fact that it was linked so strongly to his ancient ancestors Bobs distant relatives originated from hot climates and didnt sweat so licking themselves was their way of releasing saliva and cooling themselves down It was also their version of the invisibility cloak Smell is bad for cats from a hunting point of view Cats are stealth hunters and ambush their prey so they have to be as unobtrusive as possible Cat saliva contains a natural deodorant which is why they lick themselves a lot Its been proven by zoologists that cats that lick the smell off themselves survive longer and have more successful offspring Its also their way of hiding themselves from predators like large snakes lizards and other larger carnivorous mammals Of course the most important reason that Bob and his ancestors had always licked themselves was to establish and maintain good health Cats effectively selfmedicate Licking cuts down the number of parasites such as lice mites and ticks that can potentially damage the cat It also stops infection in any open wounds as cats saliva also contains an antiseptic agent As I watched him one day it occurred to me that this might be why Bob was licking himself so regularly He knew his body had been in a bad way This was his way of helping the healing process The other funny habit hed developed was watching television I first noticed that he watched things on screens one day when I was playing around on a computer in the local library I often popped in there on the way to Covent Garden or when I wasnt busking Id taken Bob along for a walk He had decided to sit on my lap and was staring at the screen with me I noticed that as I was moving the mouse around he was trying to swat the cursor with his paw So back at the flat as an experiment one day Id just put the TV on and left the room to go and do something in the bedroom I came back to find Bob ensconced on the sofa watching Id heard about cats watching TV from a friend whose cat lovedStar Trek The Next Generation Whenever it heard that familiar music DahDah Dah Dah DahDah Dah Dah hed come running into the room and jump on the sofa I saw it happen a few times and it was hilarious No joke Pretty soon Bob had become a bit of a telly addict as well If something caught his eye then he suddenly was glued to the screen I found it really funny watching him watching Channel Four racing He really liked the horses It wasnt something I watched but I got a real kick from watching him sitting there fascinated by it Chapter 8 Making It Official One Thursday morning a few weeks after we had started our busking partnership in Covent Garden I got up earlier than usual made us both some breakfast and headed out of the door with Bob Rather than heading for central London as usual we got off the bus near Islington Green Id made a decision With him accompanying me almost every day on the streets now I needed to do the responsible thing and get Bob microchipped Microchipping cats and dogs used to be a complicated business but now its simple All it requires is a simple surgical procedure in which a vet injects a tiny chip into the cats neck The chip contains a serial number which is then logged against their owners details That way if a stray cat is found people can scan the chip and find out where it belongs Given the life Bob and I led I figured it was a good idea to get it done If God forbid we ever got separated wed be able to find each other If worse came to worst and something happened to me at least the records would show that Bob wasnt a completely feral street cat he had once been in a loving home When Id first begun researching the microchipping process in the library I had quickly come to the conclusion that I couldnt afford it Most vets were charging an extortionate sixty to eighty pounds to insert a chip I just didnt have that kind of money and even if I did I wouldnt have paidthat much on principle But then one day I got talking to the cat lady across the street You should go along to the Blue Cross van in Islington Green on a Thursday she said They just charge for the cost of the chip But make sure you get there early Theres always a big queue So Id set off today nice and early to get to that mornings clinic which I knew ran from 10am to noon As the cat lady had predicted we discovered a lengthy queue when we got to Islington Green A long line stretched down towards the big Waterstones bookshop Luckily it was a bright clear morning so it wasnt a problem hanging around There was the usual collection you find in a situation like that people with their cats in posh carriers dogs trying to sniff each other and being a general nuisance But it was quite sociable and it was certainly a smarter more caring crowd than at the RSPCA where Id first taken Bob to be checked out What was funny was that Bob was the only cat that wasnt in a carrier so he attracted a lot of attention as usual There were a couple of elderly ladies who were absolutely smitten and kept fussing over him After about an hour and a half queuing Bob and I reached the front of the line where we were greeted by a young veterinary nurse with short bobbed hair How much will it cost to get him microchipped I asked her Its fifteen pounds she replied It was pretty obvious from my appearance that I wasnt exactly rolling in money So she quickly added But you dont have to pay it all up front You can pay it off over a few weeks Say two pounds a week hows that Cool I said pleasantly surprised I can do that She gave Bob a quick check presumably to make sure he was in decentenough health which he was He was looking a lot healthier these days especially now that he had fully shed his winter coat He was lean and really athletic She led us into the surgery where the vet was waiting He was a young guy in his late twenties probably Morning he said to me before turning to chat to the nurse They had a quiet confab in the corner and then started preparing for the chipping procedure I watched as they got the stuff together The nurse got out some paperwork while the vet produced the syringe and needle to inject the chipThe size of it slightly took my breath away It was a big old needle But then I realised it had to be if it was going to insert the chip which was the size of a large grain of rice It had to be large enough to get into the animals skin Bob didnt like the look of it at all and I couldnt really blame him So the nurse and I got hold of him and tried to turn him away from the vet so that he couldnt see what he was doing Bob wasnt stupid however and knew something was up He got quite agitated and tried to wriggle his way out of my grip Youll be OK mate I said stroking his tummy and hind legs while the vet closed in When the needle penetrated Bob let out a loud squeal It cut through me like a knife and for a moment I thought I was going to start blubbing when he began shaking in pain But the shaking soon dissipated and he calmed down I gave him a little treat from my rucksack then carefully scooped him up and headed back to the reception area Well done mate I said The nurse asked me to go through a couple of complicatedlooking forms Fortunately the information she wanted was pretty straightforward OK we need to fill in your details so that they are on the database she said We will need your name address age phone number all that kind of stuff she smiled It was only as I watched the nurse filling in the form that it struck me Did this mean that I was officially Bobs owner So legally speaking does that mean I am now registered as his owner I asked the girl She just looked up from the paperwork and smiledYes is that OK she said Yeah thats great I said slightly taken aback Really great By now Bob was settling down a little I gave him a stroke on the front of the head He was obviously still feeling the injection so I didnt go near his neck hed have scratched my arm off Did you hear that Bob I said Looks like were officially a family Im sure I drew even more looks than usual as we walked through Islington afterwards I must have been wearing a smile as wide as the Thames Having Bob with me had already made a difference to the way I was living my life Hed made me clean up my act in more ways than one As well as giving me more routine and a sense of responsibility he had also made me take a good look at myself I didnt like what I saw I wasnt proud of the fact I was a recovering addict and I certainly wasnt proud of the fact that I had to visit a clinic once a fortnight and collect medication from a pharmacy every day So I made it a rule that unless it was absolutely necessary I wouldnt take him with me on those trips I know it may sound crazy but I didnt want him seeing that side of my past That was something else hed helped me with I really did see it as my past I saw my future as being clean living a normal life I just had to complete the long journey that led to that point There were still plenty of reminders of that past and of how far I had still to travel A few days after Id had him microchipped I was rummaging around looking for the new Oyster card that had come through the post when I started emptying the contents of a cupboard in my bedroom There at the back of the cupboard under a pile of old newspapers and clothes was a plastic Tupperware box I recognised it immediately although I hadnt seen it for a while It contained all the paraphernalia I had collected when I was doing heroin There were syringes needles everything I had needed to feed my habit It was like seeing a ghost It brought back a lot of bad memories I saw images of myself that I really had hoped to banish from my mind forever I decided immediately that I didnt want that box in the house any more I didnt want it there to remind and maybe even tempt me And I definitely didnt want it around Bob even though it was hidden away from view Bob was sitting next to the radiator as usual but got up when he saw me putting my coat on and getting ready to go downstairs He followed me all the way down to the bin area and watched me as I threw the box into a recycling container for hazardous waste There I said turning to Bob who was now fixing me with one of his inquisitive stares Just doing something I should have done a long time ago Chapter 9 The Escape Artist Life on the streets is never straightforward Youve always got to expect the unexpected I learned that early on Social workers always use the word chaotic when they talk about people like me They call our lives chaotic because they dont conform to their idea of normality but it is normality to us So I wasnt surprised when asthat first summer with Bob drew to a close and autumn began life around Covent Garden started to get more complicated I knew it couldnt stay the same Nothing ever did in my life Bob was still proving a real crowdpleaser especially with tourists Wherever they came from they would stop and talk to him By now I think Id heard every language under the sun from Afrikaans to Welsh and learned the word for cat in all of them I knew the Czech namekocka and Russiankoshka I knew the Turkishkedi and my favourite the Chinesemao I was really surprised when I discovered their great leader had been a cat But no matter what weird or wonderful tongue was being spoken the message was almost always the same Everyone loved Bob We also had a group ofregulars people who worked in the area and passed by on their way home in the evening A few of them would always stop to say hello One or two had even started giving Bob little presents It was the otherlocals who were causing the problems To begin with Id been getting a bit of hassle over at James Street from the Covent Guardians Id been continuing to play next to the tube station On a couple of occasions a Guardian had come over and spoken to me Hed laid down the law explaining that the area was for painted statues The fact that there didnt seem to be any around at that moment didnt bother him You know the rules he kept telling me I did But I also knew rules were there to be bent a little when they could be Again that was life on the streets If we were the kind of people who stuck to the rules we wouldnthave been there So each time the Guardian moved me on Id head off elsewhere for a few hours then quietly slip back into James Street It was a risk worth taking as far as I was concerned Id never heard of them calling in the police to deal with someone performing in the wrong place The people who were bothering me much more were the staff at the tube station who also now seemed to object to me busking outside their workplace There were a couple of ticket inspectors in particular who had begun giving me a hard time It had begun as dirty looks and the odd casual comment when I set myself up against the wall of the tube station But then one really unpleasant inspector a big sweaty guy in a blue uniform had come over to me one day and been quite threatening By now I had come to realise that Bob was a great reader of people He could spot someone who wasnt quite right from a distance He had spotted this guy the minute he started walking in our direction and had started squeezing himself closer to me as he approached All right mate I said Not really No You had better piss off or else he said Or else what I said standing my ground Youll see he said obviously trying to intimidate me Im warning you I knew he had no power outside the tube station and was just trying to spook me But afterwards Id made the decision that it might be smart to stay away for a while So at first Id moved to the top of Neal Street near the junction with Long Acre still no more than a healthy stones throw from the tube station but far enough to be out of sight of the staff The volume of people passing there wasnt as great or always as wellmeaning as the people around Covent Garden Most times I worked there Id get some idiot kicking my bag or trying to scare Bob I could tell he wasnt comfortable there hed curl up in a defensive ball and narrow his eyes to a thin slit whenever I set up there It was his way of saying I dont like it here So after a few days rather than heading towards Covent Garden as usual Bob and I climbed off the bus and walked through Soho in the direction of Piccadilly Circus instead Of course we hadnt left central London and the borough of Westminster so there were still rules and regulations Piccadilly worked in a similar way to Covent Garden there were certain areas that were designated for buskers This time I decided to stick to the rules I knew that the area to the east ofPiccadilly Circus on the road leading to Leicester Square was a good spot specifically for buskers So I headed there Arriving there with Bob I picked a spot only a few yards away from one of the main entrances to the Piccadilly Circus tube station outside the Ripleys Believe It Or Not exhibition It was a really busy late afternoon and evening with hundreds of tourists on the street heading to the West Ends cinemas and theatres We were soon doing all right despite the fact that people move so fast around that area running down the tube entrance As usual they slowed down and sometimes stopped when they saw Bob I could tell Bob was a little nervous because he curled himself up even tighter than usual around the bridge of my guitar It was probably the number of people and the fact that he was in unfamiliar surroundings He was definitely more comfortable when he was in a place that he recognised As usual people from all over the world were milling around taking in the sights of central London There were a lot of Japanese tourists in particular a lot of whom were fascinated by Bob Id soon learned another new word for catneko Everything was fine until around six in the evening when the crowds really thickened with the beginning of the rush hour It was at that point that a promotions guy from Ripleys came out on to the street He was wearing a big inflatable outfit that made him look three times his normal size and was making big arm gestures encouraging people to visit Ripleys I had no idea how it related to the exhibits inside the building Maybe they had something on the worlds fattest man Or the worlds most ridiculous job But I could tell immediately that Bob didnt like the look of him I sensed him drawing in even closer to me when he first appeared He was really unsure of the bloke and was staring at him with a look of slight trepidation I knew exactly where he was coming from he did look a bit freaky To my relief after a while Bob settled down and seemed to forget about the man For a while we just ignored him as he carried on trying to persuade people to step into Ripleys He was having some success so he stayed away from us I was singing a Johnny Cash song Ring of Fire when for no particular reason the promotions guy suddenly approached us pointing at Bob as if he wanted to come and stroke him I didnt spot him until he was almost upon us leaning down in his weird inflatable suit And by then it was too late Bobs reaction was instantaneous He just sprung up and bolted running into the crowds with his new lead trailing behind him Before I could even react hed disappeared heading towards the entrance to the tube station Oh shit I said to myself my heart pumpingHes gone Ive lost him My instincts took over at once I jumped up straight away and ran after him I just left the guitar I was much more worried about Bob than an instrument I could find one of those anywhere I immediately found myself in a sea of people There were wearylooking office workers heading down the tube at the end of a days work early evening revellers arriving for a night up West and as always loads and loads of tourists some with rucksacks others clutching streetmaps all looking a little overwhelmed at finding themselves at the beating heart of London I had to bob and weave my way through them to even get to the entrance to the tube station Inevitably I bumped into a couple of people almost knocking over one lady It was impossible to see anything through the constant wall of people that was moving towards me but as I finally got to the bottom of the steps inside the concourse things began to thin out a little bit It was still heaving with people but at least I could now stop and take a look around I got down on my haunches and looked around at floor level One or two people gave me strange looks but that didnt concern me Bob Bob where are you mate I shouted at one point immediately realising how futile that was with all the noise in there I had to make a guess and head in one direction Should I go towards the barriers that led to the escalators and down to the trains or move towards the various other exits Which way would Bob go My hunch was that he wouldnt go down the tube Wed never been down there together and I had a feeling the moving escalators would frighten him So I moved towards the exits for the other side of Piccadilly Circus After a moment or two I got a glimpse of something just the faintest flash of ginger on one of the staircases I then saw a lead trailing after it Bob Bob I shouted again squeezing myself through the crowds once more as I headed in that direction I was now within thirty feet of him but I might as well have been a mile away the crowds were so thick There were streams of people coming down the staircase Stop him step on his lead I shouted out catching another glimpse of ginger in the evening light above me But no one was taking any notice No was paying any attention Within moments the lead had disappeared and there was no sign of Bob He must have reached the exit which led to the bottom of Regent Street and run off from there By now a million thoughts were flashing through my head none of them good ones What if he had run out into the road at Piccadilly Circus What if someone had seen him and picked him up As I barged my way up the stairs and reached street level again I was in a real state Truth be told I could have burst into tears I was so convinced that Id never see him again I knew it wasnt my fault but I felt awful Why the hell hadnt I fixed his lead to my rucksack or on to my belt so that he couldnt run any further than the length of his lead Why hadnt I spotted his panic when the Ripleys guy had first appeared and moved somewhere else I felt sick Again I had to make a choice Which way would he have headed on hitting the streets He could have turned left towards Piccadilly or even headed into the giant Tower Records store there Again I trusted my instincts and guessed that he would have basically headed straight on down the wider pavements of Regent Street Still in a complete panic I began making my way down the street in the hope that someone had seen him I knew I must have been looking absolutely crazed because people were looking at me askance Some were even moving out of my way as if I was some deranged gunman on the rampage Fortunately not everyone reacted that way After about thirty yards I asked a young girl who was walking down the road with a bag from the Apple store at the Oxford Street end of Regent Street Shed obviously walked all the way down the street so I asked her if shed seen a cat Oh yeah she said I saw a cat weaving along the street Ginger Had a lead hanging behind it One bloke tried to stamp on the lead and catch it but the cat was too quick for him My immediate reaction was joy I could have kissed her I just knew it was Bob But that quickly gave way to paranoia Who was that bloke whod tried to catch him What was he planning to do with him Would that have frightened Bob even more Was he now cowering somewhere where Id never find him With all these new thoughts bouncing around in my head I carried on down Regent Street sticking my head into every shop I passed Most of the shop assistants looked horrified to see this longhaired figure standing in their doorways and took a step back Others just flashed me blank expressions and slow shakes of the head I could see what they were thinking They thought I was some piece of dirt that had just blown in off the street After about half a dozen shops my mood began to swing again this time back towards resignation I had no idea how long it was since Bob had run off Time had seemed to slow down It was as if it was all happening in slow motion I was close to giving up A couple of hundred yards down Regent Street there was a side street ahead leading back down to Piccadilly From there he could have headed in any one of a dozen directions into Mayfair or even across the road down to St Jamess and Haymarket If hed gone that far then I knew he was lost I was about to give up and head down the side street when I stuck my head into a ladies clothes shop There were a couple of shop assistants there looking a bit perplexed and looking towards the back of the shop They turned to see me and the moment I said the wordcat their faces lit up A ginger tom one of them said Yes hes got a collar and lead Hes round the back here one of them said gesturing for me to come in and shut the door Thats why we shut the door the other one said We didnt want him to get run over We figured someone was looking for him because of the lead They led me towards a row of open wardrobes filled with fancylooking clothes I noticed the prices on some of them Each one cost more money than Id make in a month But then in the corner of one of the wardrobes curled up in a ball I saw Bob As time had slowed down during the past few minutes a part of me had wondered whether he was trying to get away from me Maybe hed had enough of me Maybe he didnt want the life I offered him any more So when I approached him I was prepared for him to bolt again and run off But he didnt Id barely whispered softly Hey Bob its me before he jumped straight into my arms All my fears about him wanting rid of me evaporated as he purred deeply and rubbed himself against me You gave me such a scare there mate I said stroking him I thought Id lost you I looked up and saw that the two shopkeepers were standing nearby watching One of them was dabbing her eyes close to tears Im so glad you found him she said He looked like such a lovely cat We were wondering what wed do with him if no one showed up before closing time She came closer and stroked Bob for a moment as well We then chatted for a couple of minutes as she and her colleague got ready to close the till and started preparing to shut up shop for the evening Bye Bob the pair said as we headed off back into the throng around Piccadilly Circus with Bob perched on my shoulder again When I got back to Ripleys I discovered to my mild amazement that my guitar was still there Maybe the security guy at the door had kept an eye on it Or perhaps one of the community support officers in the area had made sure it was safe At the time there was a mobile police unit next to us All the police and community support people loved Bob He had become very popular with the police I had no idea who the Good Samaritan was but to be honest I didnt care I was just glad that Bob and I were reunited I wasted no time in gathering up my stuff and calling it a night Wed not made enough money but that wasnt my biggest concern I stopped at a general store and with most of the cash I had on me bought myself a little belt clip that I attached first to me then to his lead It would make sure that we remained connected all the time On the bus rather than sitting on the seat next to me as usual he sat on my lap He could be an inscrutable chap but at other times I knew exactly what Bob was thinking Tonight was one of those occasions We were together and neither of us wanted that to change Chapter 10 Santa Paws During those first few days and weeks after the drama at Piccadilly Bob and I clung to each other like two survivors hanging on to a life raft at sea Wed both been badly shaken by the incident It made me think long and hard about our friendship For a while I kept wondering whether his escape had been a signal that he wanted to put some distance between us Deep down I knew that if he wanted to go back on to the streets or wherever it was he came from ultimately there was nothing I could or should do to stop him Id even thought through what I should do if he showed any sign of wanting to run away again If he did and I managed to catch him before he disappeared altogether I decided Id give him away to the RSPCA or Battersea Dogs and Cats Home where they had a really nice cattery I didnt want to be his gaoler He had been too good a friend to me for me to curtail his freedom He didnt deserve that Thankfully though it hadnt come to that Once or twice since the incident he had elected not to go out with me When I had got the harness out in the morning he had run behind the sofa or hid under the table to tell me he wasnt up for it Id left him to it But in the main he had been happy to come out every day And when he had he had been a slightly different character more attentive to me but in a strange way also more relaxed Despite what had happened at Piccadilly Circus he wasnt as frightened in crowds as he had been occasionally in the past Maybe this was because I now had him clipped to my belt and kept a tighter hold on his lead when he was out The truth was that I think he felt closer to me now Our bond had been put to the test and survived I got the impression that now he wanted to stay by my side more strongly than ever Of course it hadnt all been a bed of roses working on the streets of London there are bound to be moments when you feel threatened A couple of weeks after we saw that strange inflated character at Piccadilly we were in Covent Garden when we saw a troupe of street performers on giant stilts They were oldfashioned French performance artists and had really garish scary faces The instant he saw them tottering around above our heads I could tell Bob felt threatened He squeezed in close to me I was trying to concentrate on singing but every now and again he stopped me from playing the guitar as he flopped his tail over the fret board Cut it out Bob I said apologising to the one or two tourists whod stopped to listen Of course they thought it was funny and part of the act If only I could manage to get Bob to do what I wanted so easily As soon as the figures on stilts had disappeared it was a completely different story of course With them gone he was relaxed again and he moved away from me slightly It was as if he knew that I was his safety net I was glad to provide it As Christmas 2007 approached and our first calendar year together drew to a close our life had settled into a real routine Each morning Id get up to find him waiting patiently by his bowl in the kitchen Hed guzzle down his breakfast then give himself a good wash licking his paws and face clean Bob was still very reluctant to do his toilet inside the flat and most mornings Id take him downstairs to relieve himself On other occasions Id leave him out and let him find his own way out to the grass Hed find his way down and back up again without any trouble Id then get ready pack up my rucksack grab my guitar and head into town With Christmas only days away the crowds in Covent Garden were getting bigger and bigger So too were the number of treats and gifts Bob was getting From the very early days people had got into the habit of giving Bob little presents The first one came from a middleaged lady who worked in an office not far from James Street and would regularly stop and talk to us Shed had a ginger tom herself many years earlier and had told me that Bob reminded her of him She had arrived one evening with a big grin on her face and a smart bag from a fancy pet shopI hope you dont mind but I bought Bob a little present she said Of course not I said Its not much she said fishing out a little stuffed figure of a mouse Its got a little catnip in it she smiled Not a lot dont worry There was a part of me that felt awkward about it Catnip was after all addictive to cats Id read all sorts of stuff about how it can drive them crazy if they get hooked on it It was bad enough with me trying desperately to straighten myself out I didnt want Bob developing a habit as well But she was too nice a lady to disappoint her She stayed for a little while relishing the sight of seeing Bob playing with the little mouse As the weather took a turn for the worse people began to give Bob more practical presents One day another lady a strikinglooking Russian sidled up to us smiling Hope you dont mind but with the weather turning cold I thought Id knit Bob something to keep him warm she said producing a beautiful lightblue knitted scarf from her shoulder bag Wow I said genuinely taken aback Thats great I immediately wrapped it around Bobs neck It fitted perfectly and looked fantastic The lady was over the moon She reappeared a week or two later with a matching blue waistcoat I was no fashion expert as anyone who met me would have been able to tell in an instant but even I could tell that Bob looked amazing in it People were soon queuing to take photographs of him in it I should have charged I would have made a fortune Since then at least half a dozen more people well women had dropped off various items of knitted clothing for Bob One lady had even embroidered the name Bob into the little scarf that she had created for him It struck me one day that Bob was becoming a fashion model He was regularly modelling some new creation a kindly soul had made for him It gave a new meaning to the wordcatwalk It just underlined what Id realised already that I wasnt the only one who was forming a deep affection for Bob He seemed to make friends with almost everyone he met It was a gift I wished I had myself Id never found it that easy to bond with people No one had fallen more deeply in love with Bob than my exgirlfriend Belle We were still close friends probably better friends than when we were together and she would pop round to the flat on a regular basis It was partly to see me and hang out but I was pretty sure that she was also coming over to see Bob The two of them would play together for hours on the sofa Bob thought the world of her I could tell It was about three weeks before Christmas that she came round with a plastic shopping bag in her hand and a big grin on her face What have you got in there I said sensing she was up to something Its not for you its for Bob she said teasing me Bob was sitting in his usual spot under the radiator but perked up the minute he heard his name mentioned Bob come here Ive got a surprise for you Belle said flopping on to the sofa with the bag He was soon padding over curious to find out what was inside Belle pulled out a couple of small animal Tshirts One just had a picture of a cutelooking kitten on it But the other one was red with green trim on it It had the wordsSanta Paws in large white letters with a big paw print underneath it Oh thats really cool Bob isnt it I said Thats the perfect thing to wear when were in Covent Garden close to Christmas That will really put a smile on peoples faces It certainly did that I dont know if it was the Christmas spirit or simply seeing him in his outfit but the effect was amazing Ah look its Santa Paws Id hear people say almost every few minutes A lot of people would stop and drop a bit of silver into my guitar case others however wanted to give Bob something On one occasion this very wellheeled lady stopped and started cooing over Bob Hes fabulous she said What would he like for Christmas I dont know madam I replied Well put it this way what does he need she said He could do with a spare harness I guess Or something to keep him warm when the weather gets really cold Or just get him some toys Every boy likes toys at Christmas Jolly good she said getting up and leaving I didnt think much more of it but then about an hour later the lady reappeared She had a big grin on her face and was carrying a smartlooking handknitted stocking with cat designs on the front I looked inside and could see it was stuffed with goodies food toys and stuff You must promise me that you wont open it till Christmas she said You must keep it under your tree until Christmas morning I didnt have the heart to tell her that I didnt have enough money for a Christmas tree or any decorations in the flat The best Id been able to rustle up was a USB Christmas tree that plugged into the battered old Xbox Id recently found at a charity shop In the days after that however I made a decision She was right I should have a decent Christmas for once I had something to celebrate I had Bob I suppose Id become desensitised to Christmas because I hadnt had a decent one in years I was one of those people who actively dreaded it During the past decade or so Id spent most of them at places like Shelter where they did a big Christmas lunch for homeless people It was all very well meaning and Id had a laugh or two there But it just reminded me of what I didnt have a normal life and a normal family It just reminded me that Id cocked up my life Once or twice Id spent it on my own trying to forget the fact that my family was on the other side of the world Well most of it On a couple of occasions Id spent the day with my father After going missing for a year when I first ended up on the streets Id stayed in contact calling him very occasionally and hed invited me down to his house in south London But it hadnt been the greatest of experiences He didnt really think much of me I couldnt really blame him I wasnt exactly a son to be proud about Id been grateful for a nice lunch and a few drinks and most of all a bit of company But it hadnt really been a great success and we hadnt done it again This year was different though I invited Belle round on Christmas Eve for a drink Then for Christmas Day I splashed out on a readymade turkey breast with all the trimmings I wasnt really into cooking and didnt have the equipment even if I had been I got Bob some really nice treats including his favourite chicken meal When Christmas Day arrived we got up reasonably early and went out for a short walk so that Bob could do his business There were other families from the block heading off to see relatives and friends We all exchangedHappy Christmases and smiles Even that was more than Id experienced in a long while Back up at the flat I gave Bob his stocking He had spotted it days earlier and had obviously guessed it was meant for him I emptied the contents one by one There were treats toys balls and little soft things containing catnip He absolutely loved it and was soon playing with his new toys like an excitable child on Christmas morning It was pretty adorable I cooked our lunch early in the afternoon then put a hat on each of us had a can of beer and watched television for the rest of the afternoon and evening It was the best Christmas Id had in years Chapter 11 Mistaken Identity By the spring and summer of 2008 being a busker on the streets of London was becoming more and more difficult almost impossible at times There were a couple of reasons I know people assume the economy doesnt affect people on the streets but thats not the case at all The recession which at that point was only just gearing up had hit me and people in my position quite hard The kindhearted folk who used to think nothing of dropping me and Bob a pound or two were now holding on to their money One or two regulars even told me as much They said they were worried about losing their jobs I couldnt really argue with them So as a result I was having to work much longer hours often to make less money to feed me and Bob and keep us warm I could live with that the bigger problem was the fact that the authorities had started coming down hard on street performers who didnt work in the designated spots I wasnt sure why theyd decided to do this especially now but I did know that it had begun to make my life a real headache Most of the Covent Guardians had always been reasonable Id had trouble from the most aggressive of them but in general theyd never been really heavy with me But even they had started confiscating stuff if they felt you werent taking what they said seriously I dont think they had any new powers they had just been told to get a bit more serious about what they were doing There were also a few new faces among them One of the more aggressive of the newcomers had threatened to take away my guitar a couple of times Id managed to dissuade him by promising to play in a designated area or move out of the neighbourhood Id then sneaked around the corner for half an hour before returning to James Street It had become a constant game of hide and seek but I was running out of places to hide The new Guardians seemed to know where I was going to be Most days now Id be moved along or spoken to at some point It was wearing me down Deep down I knew that my time as a busker was drawing to an end The straw that broke the camels back came one afternoon in May that year Another of the reasons busking had become particularly hard for me was the staff at Covent Garden tube station The bad vibe Id been getting from there had become more and more unpleasant I dont know why but they didnt want me busking there There were now a number of ticket inspectors who would regularly wander across the road from the entrance to the tube station and give me a real mouthful of abuse I could handle that I was well used to it But theyd definitely been talking about me together and had come up with some kind of plan to campaign against me Every now and again they would call up the British Transport Police who would turn up and give me hassle As if I needed any more of that Id learned to deal with them in the same way as the other authorities Id slope off promising never to darken their doorstep again then slink back into position when the coast was clear I saw no harm in what I was doing No one was getting hurt were they All that changed one afternoon Id headed into Covent Garden as usual with Bob I had a friend staying with me at the time a guy called Dylan who Id met way back when I was with the band Hed been kicked out of his previous accommodation when hed refused to pay an extortionate new rent by some unscrupulous landlord He needed a floor to sleep on for a couple of weeks Id been there myself so I couldnt refuse him He had begun sleeping on my sofa Bob hadnt taken too kindly to Dylans arrival at first I think he felt he was going to lose out in my affections But as soon as he realised that Dylan was in fact another animal lover and discovered that he was going to get more attention then he was fine Bob thrived on attention This particular afternoon Dylan decided he was going to come into London with us and hang around Covent Garden It was a lovely sunny day and he felt like enjoying it He was playing with Bob as I set myself up on the corner of James Street Looking back on it I cant believe how fortunate it was that he was there Id barely put the guitar strap over my shoulder when a British Transport Police van arrived at speed and pulled up alongside the pavement Three officers jumped out and immediately started walking towards me Whats all this about Dylan said Dont know More of the usual stuff I said fully expecting to have to go through the usual tap dance of promising to move away I was wrong Right you youre coming with us one of the officers said pointing at me What for I said Were arresting you on suspicion of using threatening behaviour What Threatening who I dont know what the hell Before I could finish my sentence they had grabbed me While one of them read me my rights another one stuck me in handcuffs Well explain at the station Lets get your shit together and get in the van before we make things even worse for you he said What about my cat I said gesturing at Bob Weve got some dog kennels at the station well stick him in there another of the officers said Unless youve got someone to take him My head was spinning I had no idea what was happening But then out of the corner of my eye I saw Dylan He was looking sheepish and didnt want to get involved Dylan will you look after Bob I said Take him back to the flat The keys are in my rucksack He nodded and started moving towards Bob I watched him scoop him up and reassure him I could see the look on Bobs face he was terrified by what was happening to me Through the mesh windows at the back of the van I watched as the figures of Dylan and Bob standing on the pavement disappeared from view We drove to the British Transport Police station I still had no idea what was going on Within a few minutes I was standing in front of a desk clerk being asked to empty all my pockets and to answer all sorts of questions I was then led into a cell where I was told to wait until I was seen by an officer As I sat there in the barren cell the walls gouged with graffiti and the floors smelling of stale urine it brought awful memories flooding back Id had runins with the police before mostly for petty theft When you are homeless or have a drug habit you try to find easy options to make money And to be honest few things are easier than shoplifting My main thing was stealing meat Id lift legs of lamb and expensive steaks Jamie Oliver steaks Lamb shanks Gammon joints Never chicken chicken is too low value What I stole was the stuff with the highest price value What you get is half the price on the label If you go to a pub and sell the stuff thats what you could expect to get Pubs are very solid ground for selling stolen goods Everybody knows that The first time I did it to pay for my habit was in 2001 or 2002 something like that Before that Id been begging to feed my habit Beforethat Id been on a methadone course Id got clean but then Id started using again because things were bad Id been moved into some dodgy accommodation where everyone was using and had spiralled back into bad habits I can still remember the first time I got busted It was at the Marks and Spencers at the Angel Islington I used to dress up smartly and tie my hair back dress like a postman at the end of his daily rounds popping in for a snack or a pint of milk on the way home It was all about appearance You had to be clever about it If Id walked in with a rucksack or a shopping bag Id never have stood a chance I carried a postmans Royal Mail bag around with me Its different today but back then nobody looked twice at you if you had one of those bags slung over your shoulders Anyhow I got stopped one day I had about one hundred and twenty pounds worth of meat on me I was taken into police custody At that time they gave me an onthespot fine of eight pounds for theft I was lucky to get that because it was my first time Of course it didnt stop me I had a habit I had to do what I had to do I was on heroin and an occasional bit of crack You take the risk You have to When you get nicked it sucks But you have got to bite the bullet Obviously you sit there feeling sorry for yourself but you arent going to fight the powers that be You try to get out of it you make up lies but they dont believe you They never really do Its a vicious circle when you are down That was why busking had been so good for me It was legal It kept me straight But now here I was back in the nick It felt like a real kick in the stomach Id been in the cell for about half an hour when the door opened suddenly and a whiteshirted officer ushered me out Come on he said Where are you taking me now I asked Youll see he said I was taken into a bare room with a few plastic chairs and a single table There were a couple of officers sitting opposite me They looked disinterested to be honest But then one of them started questioning me Where were you yesterday evening at around 630pm one of them asked Um I was busking in Covent Garden I said Where On the corner of James Street opposite the entrance to the tube I said which was true Did you go into the tube station at any time that evening the copper asked No I never go in there I said I travel by bus Well how come weve got at least two witnesses saying that you were in the station and that you verbally abused and spat at a female ticket attendant Ive got absolutely no idea I said bemused They saw you come up the escalator from the tube and try to go through the automatic barrier without a ticket Well as I say that cant have been me I said When you were challenged you verbally abused a female member of staff I just sat there shaking my head This was surreal You were then led to the ticket booth and asked to buy a ticket he went on When you did so against your will you then spat at the window of the ticket booth That was it I lost my cool Look this is bullshit I said I told you I wasnt in the tube station last night Im never in there And I never travel by tube Me and my cat travel everywhere by bus They just looked at me as if I was telling the biggest lies in the world They asked me if I wanted to make a statement so I did explaining that Id been busking all night I knew the CCTV footage would back this up But at the back of my mind I was having all sorts of paranoid thoughts What if this was all a fit up What if they had doctored the CCTV footage in the tube station What if it went to court and it was my word against three or four London Underground officers Worst of all I found myself anxiously wondering what would happen to Bob Who would look after him Would he stay with them or head back on to the street And what would happen to him there Thinking about it did my head in They kept me in for about another two or three hours After a while I lost all track of time There was no natural light in the room so I had no idea whether it was day or night outside At one point a lady police officer came in with a surlylooking male officer behind her I need to do a DNA test she said as he took a position in the corner where he stood with his arms folded glaring at me OK I said ignoring him I figured I had nothing to lose What do I have to do I asked the female officer Just sit there and Ill take a swab of saliva from your mouth she said She produced a little kit with loads of swabs and test tubes Suddenly I felt like I was at the dentist Open wide she said She then stuck a long cotton bud into my mouth gave it a bit of a scrape around the inside of my cheek and that was that All done she said putting the bud in a test tube and packing her stuff away Eventually I was let out of the cell and taken back to the desk at the front of the station where I signed for my stuff I had to sign a form saying that I was released on bail and told that I had to return a couple of days later When will I know if I am being formally charged I asked the duty officer suspecting that he couldnt really tell me that To my surprise he said that Id probably know when I came back in a couple of days time Really I said More than likely he said That was good and bad I decided immediately Good in the sense that Id not have to wait months to find out if I was going to be charged bad in the sense that if they were going to charge me I could find myself spending time inside very soon I really didnt relish that prospect After finally being let free I emerged into the streets behind Warren Street in pitch darkness There were already little groups of homeless people hunkering down for the night hiding themselves away in alleyways It was approaching eleven oclock By the time I got back to Seven Sisters tube station it was close to midnight and the streets were full of drunks and people being turfed out of the pubs I breathed a huge sigh of relief when I got inside the flat Dylan was watching television with Bob curled up in his usual spot under the radiator The minute I walked through the door he jumped up and padded over to me tilting his head to one side and looking up at me Hello mate you all right I said dropping to my knees and stroking him He immediately clambered up on to my knee and started rubbing against my face Dylan had headed off into the kitchen but soon reappeared with a cold tin of lager from the fridge Thats a life saver thanks I said ripping the ring off the tin and taking a slug of cold beer I sat up for a couple of hours with Dylan trying to make sense of what had happened to me I knew the ticket collectors at Covent Garden tube didnt like me but I didnt think theyd go so far as to try and frame me for a crime I didnt commit Theres no way they can fix the DNA to match yours mate Dylan reassured me I wish I could have been so certain I slept fitfully that night Id been really shaken by the experience No matter how much I tried to tell myself it would work out fine I couldnt erase the thought that my life could be about to take a terrible turn I felt powerless angry and really scared I decided to give Covent Garden a wide berth the following day Bob and I played around Neal Street and one or two other places towards Tottenham Court Road But my heart wasnt in it I was too worried about what was going to happen when I turned up at the police station the following day Again that night I struggled to get much sleep I was due to report at the Transport Police station at midday but set off early to make sure I was on time I didnt want to give them any excuses I left Bob back at home just in case I was going to be kept there for hours again He had picked up on my anxiety as Id paced around the flat eating my toast at breakfast Dont worry mate Ill be back before you know it I reassured him as I left If only Id been as confident of that as I sounded It took me a while to find the station which was hidden away on a backstreet off Tottenham Court Road Id arrived there in the back of a van and left after dark so it wasnt surprising that I had trouble finding it When I did locate it I had to sit and hang around for twenty minutes during which time I found it hard to concentrate on anything I was eventually called into a room where a couple of officers were waiting for me one man and a younger woman They had files in front of them which looked ominous I wondered what theyd dug up about my past God only knows what skeletons were hiding in that particular cupboard The male officer was the first to speak He told me that I wasnt going to be charged with the offence of using threatening behaviour I guessed why that was The DNA didnt match the saliva on the ticket collectors booth did it I said feeling suddenly empowered by what hed told me He just looked at me with a tightlipped smile He couldnt say anything I knew that But he didnt need to It seemed obvious to me that someone at the tube station had tried to fit me up but had failed If that was the good news the bad news wasnt long in following The lady told me that I was being charged with illegally busking ortouting for reward to give it its formal title They shoved a piece of paper towards me and told me I was to report to court in a weeks time I left the station relievedTouting for reward was a relatively minor offence certainly compared to threatening behaviour If I was lucky Id get away with a small fine and a rap across the knuckles nothing more Threatening behaviour would have been a completely different matter of course That would have left me open to a heavy punishment maybe even imprisonment Id got off lightly Part of me wanted to fight back at the injustice of what had happened to me The description of the person who spat on the window bore no relation to my appearance I held on to the paperwork and thought I could do them for wrongful arrest But to be honest the main thought in my mind as I headed home that afternoon was relief and a sense that Id turned some sort of corner I wasnt sure yet what it was I still had to get past the court hearing I went to the local Citizens Advice centre and got a bit of legal advice I should probably have done that earlier but Id been too messed up to think of it It turned out that because I was on a drug rehab programme and living in sheltered accommodation I was eligible for legal aid But the truth was I didnt think I needed a solicitor representing me in court so I simply got some advice about what to say It was pretty straightforward I needed to front up and admit that I was guilty of busking plain and simple I simply had to go along plead accordingly and hope the magistrate wasnt some kind of sadist with a hatred for street musicians When the day came I put on a clean shirt over the top of a Tshirt bearing the sloganExtremely Unhappy and had a shave before heading to court The waiting area was full of all sorts of people from some really scarylooking guys with shaven heads and Eastern European accents to a couple of middleaged guys in grey suits who were up on driving offences James Bowen The court calls Mr James Bowen a plummysounding voice eventually announced I took a deep breath and headed in The magistrates looked at me like I was a piece of dirt that had been blown in off the street But under the law there wasnt too much they could do to me especially as it was my first offence for busking I got a threemonth conditional discharge I wasnt fined But they made it clear that if I did reoffend I could face a fine and even worse Belle and Bob were waiting for me outside the courthouse after the hearing was over Bob immediately jumped off her lap and walked over to me He didnt want to be too melodramatic about it all but it was clear he was pleased to see me How did it go Belle asked Threemonth conditional discharge but if I get caught again Im for the high jump I said So what are you going to do she said I looked at her then looked down at Bob The answer must have been written all over my face I had reached the end of the road Id been busking on and off now for almost a decade Times had changed and my life had changed certainly since Bob had come into it So it was becoming more and more clear to me that I couldnt carry on busking it didnt make any sense on any level There were times when it didnt earn me enough money to make ends meet There were times when it put me and more importantly Bob in dangerous situations And now there was a real danger that if I was caught busking in the wrong place again I could get banged up in prison It just wasnt worth it I dont know what Im going to do Belle I said But the one thing I know Im not going to do is carry on busking Chapter 12 Number 683 My head was spinning for the next few days I felt a real mixture of emotions Part of me was still angry at the unfairness of what had happened I felt like Id lost my livelihood simply because a few people had taken against me At the same time however another part of me had begun to see it might have been a blessing in disguise Deep down I knew I couldnt carry on busking all my life I wasnt going to turn my life around singing Johnny Cash and Oasis songs on street corners I wasnt going to build up the strength to get myself totally clean by relying on my guitar It began to dawn on me that I was at a big crossroads that I had an opportunity to put the past behind me Id been there before but for the first time in years I felt like I was ready to take it That was all very well in theory of course I also knew the brutal truth my options were pretty limited How was I now going to earn money No one was going to give me a job It wasnt because I was stupid I knew that Thanks to the IT work Id done when I was a teenager back in Australia I was fairly knowledgeable when it came to computers I spent as much time as I could on friends laptops or on the free computers at the local library and had taught myself a fair bitabout the subject But I didnt have any references or relevant experience in the UK to rely on and when a prospective employer asked me where Id spent the past ten years I couldnt exactly say Id been working for Google or Microsoft So I had to forget that There wasnt even any point in me applying to do a training course in computing because they wouldnt accept me Officially I was still on a drug rehabilitation programme I was living in sheltered accommodation and didnt even have an O level to my name They wouldnt and probably couldnt touch me with a bargepole All in all I was a nonstarter when it came to getting a normal job Whatever normal is I realised quickly that there was only one realistic alternative I didnt have the luxury of being able to wait for something to turn up I needed to make money to look after myself and Bob So a couple of days after the court hearing I set off with Bob for Covent Garden for the first time in years without my guitar on my back When I got to the piazza I headed straight for the spot where I knew Id probably find a girl called Sam the areasBig Issuecoordinator I had tried selling theBig Issue before back in 1998 and 1999 when I first ended up on the streets Id got myself accredited and worked the streets around Charing Cross and Trafalgar Square It hadnt worked out Id lasted less than a year before I gave it up I could still remember how difficult it was When I was selling theBig Issue so many people used to come up to me and snarlget a job That used to really upset me They didnt realise that selling theBig Issueis a job In fact being aBig Issue seller effectively means you are running your own business When I was selling the magazine I had overheads I had to buy copies to sell So each day I turned up at the coordinators stand I had to have at least a few quid in order to buy a few copies of the magazine That old saying is as true forBig Issuesellers as it is for anyone else you have to have money to make money So many people think its a complete charity job and that they give the magazines to the sellers for free Thats just not the case If it was people would be selling a lot more than they do TheBig Issue philosophy is that it is helping people to help themselves But back then I wasnt really sure I wanted any help I wasnt ready for it I could still remember some of the grim souldestroying days Id spent sitting on a wet and windy streetcorner pitch trying to coax and cajole Londoners to part with their cash in return for a magazine It was really hard especially as back then my life was still ruled by drugs All I usually got for my trouble was a load of abuse or a kick in the ribs Most of all it had been hard because I had been invisible Most people just didnt give me the time of day They would do all they could to avoid me in fact Thats why I had turned to busking at least then I had my music to attract peoples attention and let them know I was actually a living breathing creature And even then most of them ignored me I wouldnt have even contemplated going back to selling theBig Issue if it hadnt been for Bob The way hed transformed my fortunes and my spirits on the streets had been amazing If I could do as well selling theBig Issue as Id done busking with Bob then maybe I could take that big step forward Of course there was only one problem I had to get them to accept me first I found Sam at the spot where the areasBig Issue sellers gathered to buy their magazines on a side street off the main piazza of Covent Garden There were a few vendors there all men I recognised one or two of the faces One of them was a guy called Steve who I knew was a driver for the magazine Id seen him around the place delivering the magazines on Mondays when the new issues came out Wed registered each others presence around Covent Garden a couple of times and were a bit wary of each other I got the distinct impression he wasnt very pleased to see me but I didnt care I hadnt come to see him it was Sam I needed to talk to Hello you two not busking today she said recognising me and Bob and giving him a friendly pat No Im going to have to knock that on the head I said Bit of trouble with the cops If I get caught doing it illegally again Im going to be in big trouble Cant risk it now Ive got Bob to look after Can I mate OK Sam said her face immediately signalling that she could see what was coming next So I said rocking up and down on my heels I was wondering Sam smiled and cut me offWell it all depends on whether you meet the criteria she said Oh yeah I do I said knowing that as a person in what was known as vulnerable housing I was eligible to sell the magazine But you are going to have to go through all the red tape and go down to Vauxhall to sign up she said Right You know where the offices are she said reaching for a card Not sure I said I was sure the offices had been somewhere else when Id signed up years ago Get a bus to Vauxhall and get off by the train station Its across the road from there not far from the river on the oneway system she said Once youre badged up just come back here and see me and we can get you going I took the card and headed home with BobBetter get ourselves organised Bob I said Were going for a job interview I needed to get some paperwork sorted before I could go to theBig Issue office so the next day I went to see my housing worker In any case I was supposed to see her regularly I explained my current situation and what had happened with the Transport Police She happily gave me a letter saying that I was living invulnerable housing and that selling theBig Issue would be a good way of helping me get my life back together again The day after that I made myself look respectable got my hair tied back put on a decent shirt and set off for Vauxhall with all the bits and pieces I needed I also took Bob with me Part of my thinking was that Bob might help me sell magazines in the way that hed helped me make money busking He was going to be part of my team so I wanted to get him registered as well if that was at all possible TheBig Issue offices are in an ordinarylooking office block on the south side of the Thames near Vauxhall Bridge and the MI6 building The first thing I noticed when I arrived in the reception area was a large sign sayingNo Dogs Allowed Apparently they used to allow dogs in there but they had banned them as so many dogs had started fighting with each other It didnt say anything about cats however After filling in a few bits of paper I was told to take a seat and wait After a while I was called in to have an interview with a guy in one of the offices He was a decent bloke and we chatted for a while Hed been on the streets himself years ago and had used theBig Issue as a steppingstone to help get his life together I explained my circumstances He was sympathetic I know what its like out there James believe me he said It took just a few minutes before he gave me a thumbsup sign and told me to go and get badged up in another office I had to have my photo taken and then wait to get a laminated badge with my vendor number on it I asked the guy who was issuing the badges whether Bob could have an ID card as well Sorry he said shaking his head Pets arent allowed to have their own badges Weve had this before with dogs Never with a cat though Well what about if he is in the picture with me I asked He pulled a face as if to say Im not sure about that But in the end he relented Go on then he said Smile Bob I said as we sat in front of the camera As he waited for the photo to be processed the guy got on with the rest of the registration process When you become aBig Issue seller you get assigned a random number They are not issued in sequence If they did that the numbers would now be running into the thousands because so many people have signed up to sell theBig Issue over the years then just disappeared off the face of the earth So when someone fails to show up on the records for a while the number comes back into circulation They have to do that After waiting about a quarter of an hour the guy reappeared at the desk Here you go Mr Bowen he said handing me the laminated badge I couldnt help breaking into a big grin at the picture Bob was on the lefthand side We were a teamBig Issue Vendors Number 683 It was a long journey back to Tottenham involving two buses So I whiled away the hour and a half it took us reading through the little booklet they gave me Id read something similar ten years earlier but hadnt really retained any of it If I was honest Id not really taken it seriously Id been too out of it a lot of the time This time around I was determined to take it more seriously It began with the magazines main philosophy TheBig Issue exists to offer homeless and vulnerably housed people the opportunity to earn a legitimate income by selling a magazine to the general public We believe in offeringa hand up not a hand out and in enabling individuals to take control of their lives Thats exactly what I want I said to myself a hand up And this time Ill accept it The next bit stated that I had toundergo an induction process and sign up to the code of conduct I knew the first bit meant that Id have to work at a trial pitch where my performance would be watched and assessed by the local organisers If that went well Id be allocated a fixed pitch it went on Id also get ten free copies of the magazine to get me started It made it clear that it was then down to me Once they have sold these magazines they can purchase further copies which they buy for £1 and sell for £2 thereby making £1 per copy The rules went on to explain that vendors were employed by theBig IssueWe do not reimburse them for magazines which they fail to sell hence each individual must manage their sales and finances carefully These skills along with the confidence and selfesteem they build through selling the magazine are crucial in helping homeless people reintegrate into mainstream society That was the simple economics of it But there was a lot more to it than that as I would soon discover The next morning I headed back down to Covent Garden to see Sam the coordinator I was keen to get on with myinduction All go OK down at Vauxhall she said as Bob and I approached her I guess it must have done They gave me one of these I grinned proudly producing my laminated badge from under my coat Great Sam said smiling at the photo of me and Bob Id better get you started then She began by counting out my ten free copies of the magazine There you go she said You know youll have to buy them after this Yep I understand I said For a few minutes she studied a sheet of papers Just trying to work out where to put your trial pitch she said apologetically A moment or two later I could see shed made up her mind Found somewhere I asked feeling quite excited about it Think so Sam said I couldnt believe what she said next OK well give you the training pitch just here she said pointing in the direction of Covent Garden tube station a few yards further up James Street I couldnt stop myself from bursting out laughing Are you OK Is that a problem she said looking confused I can look to see if theres somewhere else No its not a problem at all I said Itll be great there Itll be a real walk down memory lane Ill get started right away I wasted no time and set up immediately It was midmorning a few hours before Id normally have set up busking but there were lots of people milling around mostly tourists It was a bright sunny morning which I knew from experience always puts people in a better and more generous mood When Id been busking Id always felt like I was running the gauntlet of the authorities by playing here Selling theBig Issue was a totally different prospect I was officially licensed to be there So I placed myself as close to the station as possible without actually being inside the concourse I couldnt resist looking inside to see if there was any sign of the ticket officers whod given me grief in the past Sure enough I saw one of them a big sweaty fat guy in a blue shirt He was too tied up to notice me at this stage but I knew that he would at some point In the meantime I got on with the job of trying to shift my ten copies of theBig Issue I knew theyd given me this pitch because as far as normalBig Issue sellers were concerned it was a nightmare The entrance and exit of a tube station is not a place where people usually have the time to slow down and engage with someone trying to sell them something They are in a hurry they have got places to go people to see A normalBig Issue seller would have done well to stop one in every thousand people that raced past him or her It would have been a thankless task During my time busking across the street Id spent enough time watching a succession of vendors try and fail to catch peoples attention there to know the reality But I also knew that I wasnt a normalBig Issue seller I had a secret weapon one that had already cast his spell on Covent Garden And he was soon weaving his magic Id put Bob down on the pavement next to me where he was sitting contentedly watching the world go by A lot of people didnt notice him as they flew past on their mobile phones fishing inside their pockets for their tickets But a lot of people did Within moments of me setting up a couple of young American tourists had pulled up to a halt and started pointing at Bob Aaaah one of them said immediately reaching for her camera Do you mind if we take a picture of your cat the other one asked Sure why not I said pleased that unlike so many people theyd had the decency to ask Would you like to buy a copy of theBig Issue while youre at it It will help him and me get some dinner tonight Oh sure the second girl said looking almost ashamed that shed not thought of it Its no problem if you dont have the money I said Its not compulsory But before I could say anything else shed given me a fivepound note Oh Im not sure Ive got any change Ive literally just started I said feeling flustered myself now I know a lot of people thinkBig Issue sellers routinely say this but I genuinely didnt have much in my pockets When I counted it out I had just under a pound in shrapnel in my pocket and handed that over to her Thats fine she said Keep the change and buy your cat something nice to eat As the American girls left another group of tourists passed by this time Germans Again they started cooing over Bob They didnt buy a magazine but it didnt matter I knew already that Id have no trouble selling the ten copies In fact I might even be heading back to Sam for some more stock before the end of the day Sure enough I sold six copies within the first hour Most people gave me the correct money but one elderly gent in a smart tweed suit gave me a fiver I was already feeling vindicated in making this move I knew I wouldnt always fare this well and that there would be ups and downs But I already felt like Id taken a big step in a new direction It had been a pretty good day already but the icing on the cake came after Id been there for about two and a half hours By now I was down to my last two magazines I was suddenly aware of a bit of a commotion inside the station All of a sudden a small group of London Underground staff appeared in the concourse in full view of me They seemed to be deep in conversationabout something and one or two of them were on walkietalkies My mind couldnt help going back to what had recently happened to me I wondered whether there had been another incident and whether some other poor sap was going to be fitted up for a crime that he hadnt committed Whatever the panic was however it soon passed and they began to disperse It was then that the large sweaty figure of the ticket attendant spotted me and Bob outside the station He immediately marched in our direction He looked hassled and hot tempered and was as red as a beetroot in the face They say that revenge is a dish best eaten cold so I decided to stay cool What the f are you doing here he said I thought youd been locked up You know youre not supposed to be here I didnt say anything at first Instead very slowly and deliberately I flashed him myBig Issue badge Im just doing my job mate I said savouring the mixture of bewilderment and anger that immediately began spreading across his face I suggest you get on with yours Chapter 13 Pitch Perfect I hadnt got many decisions right in my life Whenever Id been given an opportunity in the past ten years Id screwed things up big time Within a couple of days of deciding to become aBig Issue seller however I was pretty sure that Id taken a step in the right direction for once It had an immediate impact on life for me and Bob For a start it gave us more structure I effectively had a Monday to Friday job well a Monday to Saturday one in fact For those first two weeks Bob and I worked at Covent Garden from Monday to Saturday which tied in with the publication of the magazine The new edition would come out each Monday morning Wed be there from sometime in the middle of the morning and often finish at the end of the early evening rush hour which was around 7pm We stayed for as long as it took us to sell a batch of papers Being with Bob had already taught me a lot about responsibility but theBig Issue took that to another level If I wasnt responsible and organised I didnt earn money And if I didnt earn money Bob and I didnt eat So from that very first fortnight I had to grasp how to run myBig Issue pitch as a business For someone whose life had been completely disorganised for the best part of ten years this was a huge leap Id never been great with money and had to live from hand to mouth I surprised myself with the way I adapted to the new demands There were downsides of course there were bound to be There is no sale or return with theBig Issue so I learned quickly that if you miscalculated the amount of magazines you could lose out quite badly You can take a serious blow if you are stuck with fifty papers on Saturday night Come Monday you get no credit against the next purchase from the old magazines so the old papers are pulp At the same time you didnt want to under buy Too few and youd sell out too quickly and miss out on willing buyers It was no different from running Marks and Spencers well in theory The other thing you had to factor in was that there was a huge difference in the quality of the magazines from week to week Some weeks it would be a good issue packed with interesting stuff Other weeks it would be quite dull and really hard to sell especially if the cover didnt have some famous film or rock star on it It could be a bit unfair It took a while to get the balance right While I was working out the best way to sell theBig Issue I still lived from hand to mouth What I earned between Monday and Saturday evening was generally gone by Monday morning Sometimes at the start of each week Id turn up at the coordinators stand with only a few quid If Sam was there Id ask her to do me a favour and buy ten papers for me on the understanding Id pay her back as soon as I had some money She would usually do this for vendors who she knew she could trust to repay her and I had done this once or twice before when I was desperate and always repaid her within hours I knew the money was coming out of her pocket not theBig Issues so it was only fair Then when I had sold those copies Id go back and pay off what I owed and get some more papers Id build it up that way from there As a result of this in real terms I was actually making less money than I had been busking with Bob But as I settled down into this new routine I decided it was a price worth paying The fact that I was working legitimately on the streets made a huge difference to me If I got stopped by a policeman I could produce my badge and be left in peace After the experience with the Transport Police that meant a lot The next couple of months working at the tube station flew by In many ways it was similar to busking Wed attract the same sort of people a lot of middleaged and elderly ladies groups of female students gay guys but also people from all walks of life One day during the early part of the autumn of 2008 we were approached by a very flamboyantlooking guy He had bleachedblond hair and was wearing jeans cowboy boots and I could tell that the leather jacket and jeans must have cost a fortune I was sure he was an American rock star he certainly looked like one As hed walked along he had immediately spotted Bob He stopped in his tracks and smiled Thats one cool cat he said in a sort of transatlantic drawl He looked really familiar but I couldnt for the life of me place him I was dying to ask him who he was but thought it was rude I was glad I didnt He spent a minute on his knees just stroking Bob You guys been together long he asked Uhhmm gosh let me think I said having to work it out Well we got together in the spring of last year so its about a year and a half now Cool You look like real soul brothers he smiled Like you belong together Thanks I said by now desperate to know who the hell this guy was Before I could ask him he got up and looked at his watch Hey gotta go see you guys around he said reaching into a pocket in his jacket and producing a wad of cash He then dropped a tenner into my hand Keep it he said as I began to rummage around for change You guys have a good day We will I promised him And we did It made such a difference that I was now working outside the tube station legitimately Id had a couple of moments with some of the familiar faces from the tube station again one or two of whom had given me some filthy looks Id ignored them The rest of the staff there were actually fine They knew I was getting on with my job and as long as I didnt offend or harass anyone that was fine Inevitably Bob and I had also got a bit of attention from otherBig Issue vendors in the area I wasnt so naive as to think that everything was going to be all sweetness and light with the other vendors and assorted street workers Life on the streets wasnt like that It wasnt a community built on caring for each other it was a world in which everyone looked after number one But to begin with at least most of the otherBig Issue sellers reacted warmly to the sight of the new guy with a cat on his shoulders There had always been vendors around with dogs One or two of them had been real characters But as far as I was aware there had never been aBig Issue seller with a cat in Covent Garden or anywhere else in London before Some of the vendors were rather sweet about it A few of them came up and started stroking him and asking questions about how we met and what I knew about his background The answer of course was nothing He was a blank slate a mystery cat which seemed to endear everyone to him even more No one was interested in me of course The first thing theyd say when they saw us again was Hows Bob today No one ever asked how I was But that was OK that was to be expected I knew the air of bonhomie wouldnt last It never did on the streets With Bob at my side I discovered that I could sell as many as thirty or even fifty papers on a good day At£2 a paper as they were priced back then it could add up quite well especially with the tips that some people gave me or more usually Bob One early autumn evening Bob was sitting on my rucksack soaking up the last of the days sun when a very wellheeled couple walked past the tube station To judge by their outfits they were heading for the theatre or maybe even the opera He was wearing a tuxedo and a bow tie and she had a black silk dress on You two look very smart I said as they stopped and started drooling over Bob The lady smiled at me but the guy ignored me Hes gorgeous the lady said Have you been together for a long time Quite a while I said We kind of found each other on the streets Here you go the guy said suddenly pulling out his wallet and removing a twentypound note Before I could even reach into my coat to fish out some change hed waved me away No thats fine keep it he said smiling at his companion The look she gave him spoke volumes I had a feeling they were on a first date She had clearly been impressed by him giving me that much money As they walked off I noticed her leaning into him and wrapping her arm into his I didnt care whether it was genuine or not It was the first time Id ever been given a twentypound drop After a few more weeks of trying out the spot at the tube station I realised that far from being a bad pitch the tube station was actually ideal for me and Bob So I was disappointed when Sam told me that having finished my probation period I would be moving to another pitch at the end of the fortnight It wasnt exactly a surprise The thing about being a member of theBig Issue vendor community is that everyone can see how well each other is doing When the vendors go to the coordinator they can see who has been buying what quantities on a list thats there for everyone to see You can read it and spot who has been buying papers in batches of tens and twenties and how many batches they are buying So during that first fortnight they would have seen that I was buying a lot of magazines It soon became obvious that it was something that had been spotted by some of the other vendors In that second week I noticed a subtle but definite change in the attitude towards me I wasnt at all surprised when Sam told me that Id ended my probation and would now be moved to a different pitch Our new location wasnt a long way from the tube station on the corner of Neal Street and Shorts Gardens outside a shoe shop called Size I got the distinct feeling that the older hands had taken a dislike to me and Bob and hadnt taken too kindly to us doing so well out of what was supposed to be a bad pitch For once however I buttoned my lip and accepted itChoose your battles James I counselled myself It turned out to be good advice Chapter 14 Under the Weather It was a cold and wet autumn that year The trees were soon being stripped of their foliage as the cold winds and heavy rains began to build On one particular morning as Bob and I left the block of flats and set off for the bus stop the sun was once more nowhere to be seen and a light fine drizzle was falling Bob wasnt a big fan of the rain so at first I assumed it was to blame for the lethargic way in which he began padding his way along the path He seemed to be taking each step at a time almost walking in slow motionMaybe hes got second thoughts about joining me today I said to myselfOr maybe it was true what they said about cats being able to sense bad weather in the air As I cast an eye up to the sky a giant bank of steely grey clouds were hovering over north London like some vast alien spaceship It was probably going to be like this all day There was almost certainly some heavier rain on its way Maybe Bob was right and we should turn around I thought for a second But then I remembered the weekend was coming and we didnt have enough money to get through itBeggars cant be choosers even if they have been cleared of all charges I said to myself trying to make light of the predicament I was never happy to be working on the streets of London but today it seemed an even bigger pain in the butt than usual Bob was still moving at a snails pace and it had taken us a couple of minutes to get a hundred yards down the road Come on mate climb aboard I said turning around and ushering him up into his normal position He draped himself on my shoulder and we trudged off towards Tottenham High Road and the bus The rain was already intensifying Fat heavy drops of water were bouncing off the pavement Bob seemed fine as we sploshed our way along ducking under any available shelter as we went But as we settled into our bus journey I realised there was more to his low spirits than just the weather The ride was normally one of his favourite parts of the day Bob was a curious cat Normally the world was an endlessly interesting place to him No matter how often we did it he would never tire of pressing himself against the glass But today he wasnt even bothered about taking the window seat not that hed have seen much through the condensation and streaks of rain that obscured our view of the outside world Instead he curled up on my lap He seemed tired His body language was droopy Looking at his eyes he seemed a bit drowsy asif he was half asleep He was definitely not his normal alert self It was when we got off at Tottenham Court Road that he took a distinct turn for the worse Luckily the rain had eased off a bit by now and I was able to splash my way through the backstreets in the direction of Covent Garden It wasnt an easy process and I kept hopping around to sidestep the bigger puddles and the giant umbrellas that flew at me every now and then As we walked down Neal Street I was suddenly aware that Bob was behaving oddly on my shoulder Rather than sitting there impassively as normal he was twitching and rocking around You all right there mate I said slowing down All of a sudden he began moving in a really agitated way making weird retching noises as if he was choking or trying to clear his throat I was convinced he was going to jump or fall off so I placed him down on the street to see what was wrong But before I could even kneel down he began to vomit It was nothing solid just bile But it just kept coming I could see his body convulsing as he retched and fought to expel whatever it was that was making him sick For a moment or two I wondered whether it was my fault and he felt queasy because of all the motion today But then he was sick again retching away and producing more bile It was clearly more than motion sickness Pretty soon he didnt have anything left to bring up which was puzzling because hed eaten well the night before and at breakfast That was when I realised there must be more to it than this He must have been sick already today even before we left the flats probably when hed been in the garden doing his business He must have been feeling sick during the bus journey too I could now see I blamed myself for not spotting it sooner Its weird how you react in a situation like that Im sure my instincts were the same as any parent or pet owner All sorts of crazy sometimes conflicting thoughts rushed through my mind Had he simply eaten something that disagreed with him this morning Had he swallowed something in the flat that had set him off Or was this something more serious Was he going to drop dead in front of me Id heard stories about cats collapsing in front of their owners after drinking cleaning fluids or choking on bits of plastic For a split second an image of Bob dying flashed through my head I managed to pull myself together before my imagination ran riot Come on James lets deal with this sensibly I told myself I knew that all the retching and the fact that he no longer had any liquid to bring up meant that he was getting dehydrated If I didnt do anything he could do damage to one of his organs I decided that some food and more importantly some water would be a good idea So I scraped him up and held him in my arms as we walked on to Covent Garden and a general store I knew nearby I didnt have much cash on me at all but I cobbled together enough to buy a liquidised chicken meal that Bob usually loved and some good mineral water I didnt want to risk giving him contaminated tap water That might make matters even worse I carried him to Covent Garden and placed it down on the pavement near our normal pitch I got out Bobs bowl and spooned the chicken into it Here we go mate I said stroking him as I placed the bowl in front of him Ordinarily he would have pounced immediately and guzzled down a bowl of food at a rate of knots but not today Instead he stood and looked at it for a while before he decided to tuck in Even then he was very tentative about it only picking at the bowl He only ate the jelly He didnt touch a bit of the meat Again it set the alarm bells ringing This wasnt the Bob I knew and loved Something was definitely wrong I halfheartedly set myself up to start selling the magazine We needed some money to get us through the next few days especially if I was going to have to take Bob to a vet and pay for some drugs But my heart really wasnt in it I was far more concerned with watching Bob than trying to capture the attention of passersby He lay there impassive uninterested in anything Unsurprisingly not too many people stopped to make a donation I cut the day short after less than two hours Bob hadnt been sick again but he definitely wasnt right I had to get him home to the warmth and dryness of the flat I guess Id been lucky with Bob until now Ever since Id taken him under my wing he had been in perfect health 100 per cent tip top Hed had fleas early on but that was to be expected of a street cat Since Id treated him for that and given him an early worming treatment hed suffered no health problems at all Every now and again I had taken him to the Blue Cross van on Islington Green where hed been microchipped The vets and vet nurses there knew him well by now and always commented on what good condition he was in So this was alien territory for me I was terrified that it might be something serious As he lay on my lap on the bus returning to Tottenham I felt the emotions welling up every now and again It was all I could do to stop myself from bursting into tears Bob was the best thing in my life The thought of losing him was terrifying I couldnt keep that thought out of my head When we got home Bob just headed straight for the radiator where he just curled up and went straight to sleep He stayed there for hours That night I didnt sleep much worrying about him Hed been too out of it to even follow me to bed and was snoozing under the radiator in the front room I kept hauling myself out of bed to check on him Id creep up in the gloom and listen for the sound of his breathing One time I was convinced he wasnt and had to kneel down to place my hand on his diaphragm to make sure it was moving I couldnt believe how relieved I was when I found he was purring gently Money was so tight I simply had to go out again the following day That presented me with a real dilemma Should I leave Bob in the flat on his own Or should I wrap him up warm and take him into central London with me so that I could keep an eagle eye on him Luckily the weather was a lot better today The sun had decided to make an appearance And when I wandered out of the kitchen with my cereal bowl in my hands I saw Bob looking up at me He looked a little perkier today And when I offered him a little food he nibbled at it a lot more enthusiastically I decided to take him with me It was still early in the week so Id have to wait a few days before I could get him looked at by the Blue Cross van So in advance of that I decided to do some research and headed for the local library where I logged on to a computer and started researching Bobs symptoms Id forgotten what a bad idea it is to search through medical websites They always give you the worst possible scenario I punched in a few key words and came across a couple of informativelooking sites When I entered the main symptoms lethargic vomiting appetite loss and a few others a whole swathe of possible illnesses popped up Some werent too bad for instance it could have been down to hairballs or maybe even a bad case of flatulence But then I started looking at other possibilities Just the As in the list were bad enough They included Addisons disease acute kidney disease and arsenic poisoning As if they werent scary enough other options on the long list included feline leukaemia colitis diabetes lead poisoning salmonella and tonsillitis Worst of all as far as I was concerned one of the sites said it could be an early sign of bowel cancer By the time Id been reading for fifteen minutes or so I was a nervous wreck I decided to switch tack and look at the best treatments for vomiting That was more positive The sites I looked at suggested plenty of water rest and supervision So that was my plan for the next twentyfour to fortyeight hours Id basically keep an eye on him around the clock If he started vomiting again obviously Id head for the vets immediately If not Id go to the Blue Cross on Thursday The next day I decided to stay at home until late in the afternoon to give Bob a good chance to rest He slept like a log curled up in his favourite spot I wanted to keep an eye on him He seemed OK so I decided to leave him for three or four hours and try and squeeze in some selling I didnt have much option Trudging through the streets that led from Tottenham Court Road to Covent Garden I was aware of my invisibility again When I got to Covent Garden all everyone could ask wasWheres Bob When I told people that he was ill they were all really concerned Is he going to be all right Is it serious Is he going to see a vet Is he OK on his own at home It was then that an idea struck me I had come across a vet nurse called Rosemary Her boyfriend Steve worked at a comicbook shop near where we sometimes set up Bob and I would pop in there every now and again and we had become friends Rosemary had been in there with Steve one day and wed struck up a conversation about Bob I decided to stick my head in there to see if either of them was around Luckily Steve was there and gave me a phone number for Rosemary She wont mind you ringing her he said Especially as its about Bob She loves Bob When I spoke to Rosemary she asked me a load of questions What does he eat Does he ever eat anything else when hes out and about Well he rummages around in the bins I said It was a habit he had never shaken off He was an absolute terror Id seen him tear the garbage bags to pieces in the kitchen Id have to put them outside the front door He was a street cat You can take the cat off the street but you cant take the street out of the cat I could hear it in her voice it was as if a light bulb had been switched on Hmmm she said That might explain it She prescribed some probiotic medication some antibiotics and some special liquid to settle the stomach Whats your address she said Ill get it biked over to you I was taken aback Oh Im not sure that I can afford that Rosemary I said No dont worry it wont cost you anything Ill just add it to another delivery in the area she said This evening OK Yes great I said I was overwhelmed Such spontaneous acts of generosity hadnt exactly been a part of my life in the past few years Random acts of violence yes kindness no It was one of the biggest changes that Bob had brought with him Thanks to him Id rediscovered the good side of human nature I had begun to place my trust and faith in people again Rosemary was as good as her word I had no doubt she would be The bike arrived early that evening and I administered the first doses of the medicine straight away Bob didnt like the taste of the probiotic He screwed his face up and recoiled half a step when I gave him his first spoonful of it Tough luck mate I said If you didnt stick your face in rubbish bins you wouldnt have to take this stuff The medicine had an almost immediate impact That night he slept soundly and was a lot friskier the following morning I had to hold his head in my hand to make sure he swallowed the probiotic By the Thursday he was well on the road to recovery But just as a precaution I decided to pop along to see the Blue Cross van on Islington Green The nurse on duty recognised him immediately and looked concerned when I told her Bob had been under the weather Lets give him a quick check up shall we she said She checked his weight and inside his mouth and had a good feel around his body All seems well she said I think hes on the road to recovery We chatted for a couple of minutes before I headed off Just dont go rummaging in those bins any more Bob the nurse said as we left the makeshift surgery Seeing Bob sick had a profound effect on me He had seemed to be such an indestructible cat Id never imagined him getting ill Discovering that he was mortal really shook me It underlined the feeling that had been building inside me for a while now It was time for me to get myself clean I was fed up with my lifestyle I was tired of the mindnumbing routing of having to go to the DDU unit every fortnight and the chemist every day I was tired of feeling like I could slip back into addiction at any time So the next time I went to see my counsellor I asked him about coming off methadone and taking the final step towards becoming completely clean Wed talked about it before but I dont think hed ever really taken me at my word Today he could tell I was serious Wont be easy James he said Yeah I know that Youll need to take a drug called Subutex We can then slowly decrease the dosage of that so that you dont need to take anything he said OK I said The transition can be hard you can have quite severe withdrawal symptoms he said leaning forward Thats my problem I said But I want to do it I want to do it for myself and for Bob OK well I will get things moving and we will look at beginning the process in a few weeks time For the first time in years I felt like I could see the tiniest light at the end of a very dark tunnel Chapter 15 The Naughty List I could sense there was something wrong the moment I arrived at the Covent Garden coordinators stand one damp cold Monday morning A few other vendors were hanging around stamping their feet to keep warm and sipping at Styrofoam cups of tea When they noticed me and Bob a couple of them muttered to each other and threw me dirty looks as if I was an unwelcome guest When Sam the coordinator appeared from the other side of the distribution trolley where shed been collecting a new batch of papers she immediately jabbed a finger at me James I need to have a word with you she said looking stern Sure whats the problem I said approaching her with Bob on my shoulder She almost always said hello to him and gave him a stroke but not today Ive had a complaint In fact Ive had a couple of complaints What about I said A couple of vendors are saying that you are floating Youve been spotted doing it a few times around Covent Garden You know floating is against the rules Its not true I said but she just put her palm up in classic talk to the hand fashion Theres no point arguing about it The office wants you to go in for a talk I assumed that was that and headed towards the stacks of papers that had just arrived Sorry no you cant buy any more magazines until you go into Vauxhall and sort it out What I cant get any more magazines today I protested How am I going to make any money for Bob and me Sorry but you are suspended until you sort it out with head office I was upset but not entirely surprised Things had been building up to this for a while One of the many rules that you have to follow as aBig Issue seller is that you stick to selling your papers at your designated spot You arent supposed to sell at someone elses pitch And you arent supposed to float that is to sell while you are walking around the streets I was 100 per cent in agreement with the rule I wouldnt have liked it if someone started walking around next to my pitch wavingBig Issues around It was the fairest and simplest way of policing Londons army of vendors But during the past month or two Id had a couple of vendors come up to me to complain that I was floating They reckoned theyd seen me selling papers while I was walking around with Bob It wasnt true but I could see why they might have thought it Walking around with Bob had always been a stopstart process Wherever we went around London we were stopped every few yards by people wanting to stroke him and talk to him or have a photograph taken The only difference now was that people would sometimes ask to buy a copy of theBig Issue as well As I explained to the other vendors it put me in a really tricky spot What I should technically say wasSorry youll have to come to my pitch or buy one from the nearest vendor But I knew what the end result of that would be no sale which wouldnt benefit anyone A few of the vendors Id spoken to had sympathised and understood Quite a few others didnt however I guessed immediately who had reported me It didnt take a genius to work it out A month or so before Sam had issued the suspension Id been walking down Long Acre past the Body Shop where a guy called Geoff had aBig Issue pitch Gordon Roddick whose wife Anita had founded the Body Shop had strong links with theBig Issue so there were always vendors outside their stores I knew him a little bit and Id acknowledged him as I walked past But then a few moments later an elderly American couple had stopped me and Bob in the street They were incredibly polite your classic stereotype Midwestern husband and wife Excuse me sir the husband said but could I just take a picture of you and your companion Our daughter loves cats and it would make her day to see this Id been more than happy to oblige No one had called me sir for years if ever Id got so used to posing for tourists that Id perfected a couple of poses for Bob that seemed to work best for photographs I would get him on my right shoulder and turn him to face forward with his face right next to mine I did this again this morning The American couple was delighted with thisOh gee I cant thank you enough She will be thrilled to pieces with that the wife said They couldnt stop saying thank you and offered to buy a copy of the magazine I said no and pointed to Geoff a few yards away He is the officialBig Issue vendor in this area so you should go and buy it from him I said Theyd decided not to and moved on But then just as theyd been walking off the wife had leant towards me and squeezed a fiver into my hand Here you go she said Give yourself and your lovely cat a treat It was one of those classic situations where perception and reality were the complete opposite of each other Anyone who had been there would have seen I hadnt solicited money and had actively tried to push them towards Geoff To Geoff on the other hand it looked like Id not just taken money without handing over a magazine something else which was forbidden but Id compounded the crime by telling them to ignore him I knew immediately that it would look bad so I headed towards him to try and explain But I was already too late He was shouting obscenities at me and Bob before I got within ten yards I knew Geoff had a fiery temper and had a reputation for being punchy with it I decided not to risk it He was in such a rage I didnt even try to reason with him and headed off to leave him in peace It was soon pretty obvious that the incident must have become well a big issue among theBig Issue vendors After that there must have been some kind of whispering campaign against me It started with snide remarks Floating around again today one vendor said to me sarcastically as I passed his pitch one morning At least he was vaguely civil about it Another vendor around St Martins Lane had been much more direct Whose sales are you and that mangy moggie going to steal today he had snarled at me Again I tried to explain the situation but I might as well have been talking to the wall It was clear that vendors were gossiping to each other putting two and two together and coming up with five I hadnt worried about it that much at first but it had then escalated a little Not long after the incident with Geoff I started getting threats from the drunk vendorsBig Issue vendors arent supposed to drink on the job That is one of the most fundamental rules But the truth is that a lot of vendors are alcoholics and carry a can of extrastrength lager with them in their pockets Others keep a flask of something stronger and take a little nip from it every now and again to keepthem going I have to hold my hands up Id done it myself once on a particularly cold day But these guys were different They were blind drunk One day Bob and I were walking through the piazza when one of them lurched at us slurring his words and waving his arms You fing bastard well fing get you he said I wish I could say that this only happened once but it became almost a weekly event The final clue that all was not well had come one afternoon when Id been hanging around the coordinators pitch in Covent Garden Sams colleague Steve would often do her afternoon shift for her He was always good to Bob I dont think Steve liked me much but he would always make a fuss of Bob On this particular day however he had been in a foul mood towards us both I was sitting on a bench minding my own business when Steve came over to me If it was up to me you wouldnt be selling he said real venom in his voice As far as Im concerned youre a beggar Thats what you and that cat are doing I was really upset by this Id come such a long way Id made such a huge effort to fit into theBig Issue family in Covent Garden Id explained time and again what was happening with Bob but it made no difference It would go in one ear and straight back out the other So as I say I wasnt entirely surprised when Sam broke the news about my having to go to head office But it still left me reeling I walked away from Covent Garden dazed and not a little confused I really didnt know what to do now that I was on the Naughty List That night me and Bob ate our dinners then went to bed early It was getting cold and with the financial situation looking bleak I didnt want to waste too much electricity So while Bob curled up at the foot of the bed I huddled under the covers trying desperately to work out what to do next I had no idea what the suspension meant Could it mean that I would be banned for good Or was it simply a slap on the wrists I had no idea As I lay there memories came flooding back of how my busking had been unfairly brought to an end I couldnt bear the thought of being denied a livelihood by other peoples lies a second time It seemed even more unfair this time I hadnt got into any trouble until now unlike a lot of theBig Issue vendors Id seen around Covent Garden who were often breaking rules and getting told off by Sam and the other coordinators I knew about one guy who was notorious with all the sellers He was this big brash cockney geezer a very intimidating character he would growl at people in a really threatening voice Hed frighten women in particular by going up to them and saying Come on darling buy a magazine It was almost as if he was threatening them Buy one or else Apparently he used to roll the magazine up and then slip it into peoples bags as they were walking past Id also heard that he would then stop them and say That will be two pounds please and then follow them until they gave him money to go away That kind of thing doesnt help anyone Most of the time the victims would simply toss the papers into the nearest bin It wasnt even as if the money was going to a good cause This brute of a man was said to be a gambling addict and other sellers said that all he did was pump it straight back into fruit machines He had obviously broken so many of the basic rules it was ridiculous yet as far as I knew hed never been disciplined Whatever misdemeanours I had supposedly committed it didnt compare to that And it was the first time Id been accused of anything Surely that would count in my favour Surely it wasnt a question of one strike and youre out I simply didnt know Which was why I was beginning to panic The more I thought about it the more confused and helpless I felt But I knew I couldnt just do nothing So the following morning I decided to head out as normal and simply try another coordinator in a different part of London It was a risk I knew that but I figured it was one that was worth taking As aBig Issue seller you learn that there are coordinators all over town around Oxford Street Kings Cross and Liverpool Street in particular You get to know the whole network So I decided to chance my arm over at Oxford Street where Id met a couple of people in the past I arrived at the stall midmorning and tried to make the situation as lowkey as possible I flashed my badge and bought a pile of twenty papers The guy there was wrapped up in other things so barely registered me I didnt hang around long enough to give him the chance I simply headed for a spot where there was no sign of anyone else selling and took my chances I felt sorry for Bob in all this He was quite nervous and seemed disoriented and understandably so He liked routine he thrived on stability and predictability He didnt take kindly to chaos once more reentering his life Nor did I to be honest He must have been wondering why our normal routine had been so suddenly and inexplicably changed I managed to sell a decent number of magazines that day and did the same the following day I moved locations all the time imagining that theBig Issueoutreach team was on the lookout for me I knew it was illogical and slightly mad but I was paranoid terrified that I was going to lose my job I had images of me being hauled in front of some committee and being stripped of my badge and cast outWhy is this happening to us I said to Bob as we headed back on the bus one evening We didnt do anything wrong Why cant we get a break I resigned myself to having to spend the next few weeks taking my chances in other parts of London hoping that the coordinators didnt know I was persona non grata I was sitting under a battered old umbrella on a street somewhere near Victoria Station late on a Saturday afternoon when I finally told myself that I had made a mistake Well to be honest it was Bob who told me It had been hammering down with rain for about four hours and barely a person had slowed down to stop and buy a magazine I couldnt blame them They just wanted to get out of the deluge Since wed started selling early in the afternoon the only people who had shown an interest in me and Bob had been the security staff of the various buildings where wed stopped to try and take shelter Sorry mate you cant stay here theyd said to me with monotonous regularity Id found the umbrella discarded in a bin and had decided to use it in one last attempt to avert another minidisaster of a day It wasnt working I had been managing to get hold of papers from various vendors around London for about a month now I had been careful about who I approached and wherever I could I got other vendors to buy papers for me A lot of people knew who I was But there were enough who didnt know I was on the suspended list who picked up batches of ten or twenty papers for me to get me by I didnt want to get them into trouble but if they didnt know I was banned then no one could criticise them I figured it was safe and after everything I had been through over the past few months I just wanted to make a living and take care of myself and Bob It hadnt been going well though Finding the right pitch was a real problem mainly because most of the places Id set up shop werent actually licensed Bob and I had been moved on from various street corners around Oxford Street Paddington Kings Cross Euston and other stations One day after being asked to move on three times by the same policeman I got a semiofficial warning that next time Id be arrested I didnt want to go through that again It was a real catch22 situation Id made sure to steer clear of the main pitches and tried to pick places that were a bit off the beaten track But as a result Id found it really hard to sell the magazine even with Bob TheBig Issue hadnt designated its prime sales spots by accident They knew exactly where papers would sell and where they wouldnt These were the spots Id found myself occupying People were still drawn to Bob of course but the locations just werent right Inevitably this had hit me in the pocket and it had become much harder for me to manage the business side of theBig Issue Tonight I was going to hit rock bottom in that respect I had about fifteen papers left I knew I wasnt going to sell them and by Monday they would be out of date when a new edition came out I was in trouble As the light faded and the rain continued to fall I told myself that Id try a couple more pitches in the hope of shifting these papers I hadnt figured on Bob though Until now hed been as good as gold a real stoic even on the most desperately grim day Hed even put up with the regular splashings he got from passing cars and people even though I knew he hated getting soaked in the cold But when I tried to stop and sit down at the first street corner Id spotted he refused to stop walking It was extremely rare that he pulled on the lead like a dog but thats exactly what he was doing now OK Bob I get the message you dont want to stop there I said simply thinking that he didnt fancy that particular location But when he did exactly the same thing at the next spot and then again at the next spot after that the penny finally dropped You want to go home dont you Bob I said He was still walking along on the lead but on hearing this he slowed down and tilted his head almost imperceptibly in my direction giving me what for all the world looked like a raised eyebrow He then stopped and gave me the familiar look thatsaid he wanted to be picked up In that instant I made the decision Until now Bob had been a rock sticking loyally by my side despite the fact that business hadnt been so good and his bowl had consequently been a little less full of food It just underlined to me how loyal he was Now I had to be loyal to him and get us back on track with theBig Issue management I knew it was the right thing to do TheBig Issue had been a great step forward for me It had given me the biggest boost Id had for a long time well since Bob had come into my life in fact I just needed to clear up the situation with them I couldnt avoid facing the music any longer For Bobs sake as much as mine I couldnt keep doing this to him And so it was that the following Monday morning I had a good wash and put on a decent shirt and set off for Vauxhall I took Bob with me to help explain the case I really wasnt sure what to expect when I got there The worstcase scenario obviously would be that Id be stripped of my badge and banned from selling the magazine That would have been grossly unfair But I knew there would have to be some kind of punishment if they found me guilty of floating My best hope was to convince them that I hadnt been doing that Arriving at theBig Issue office I explained the situation and was told to wait Bob and I sat there for about twenty minutes before we got to see someone A youngish guy and an older woman led me into a nondescript office and asked me to shut the door behind me I held my breath and waited for the worst They gave me a real dressing down They claimed Id broken a couple of the cardinal rules Weve had complaints that youve been floating and begging they said I knew who had made the complaints but didnt let on I knew I mustnt turn it into a personality clashBig Issue vendors were supposed to get on with each other and if I sat there slagging off a list of other vendors it wasnt going to do me any good Instead I tried to explain to them how difficult it was to walk around Covent Garden with Bob without being offered money for the magazine I gave them a couple of examples one involving some blokes outside a pub who had stopped to admire Bob and offered me a fiver for three copies There was an interview in there with an actress they all fancied they told me Things like that happen all the time I told them If someone stops me outside a pub to refuse to sell them a paper would just be rude They listened sympathetically and nodded at some of the points I made We can see that Bob attracts attention Weve spoken to a few vendors who have confirmed that hes a bit of a crowd puller the young guy said with more than a hint of sympathy in his voice But when Id finished defending myself he leaned forward and broke the badish news Well were still going to have to give you a verbal warning Oh OK A verbal warning what does that mean I asked genuinely surprised He explained that it wouldnt prevent me from selling but that the situation might change if I was found guilty of floating again I felt a bit silly afterwards A verbal warning was neither here nor there I realised that Id panicked completely and typically jumped to the worst possible conclusion I hadnt understood what was going to happen I had been terrified that I was going to lose my job The images I had of me being hauled in front of some committee and being stripped of my badge and cast out were just a figment of my imagination I didnt realise it was not that serious I headed back to Covent Garden to see Sam feeling slightly sheepish about what had been happening When she saw me and Bob she smiled at us knowingly Wasnt sure whether wed see you two again she said Been into the office to sort it out I explained what had happened I then gave her the piece of paper that Id been given at the end of the meeting Looks like you are back on probation for a bit she said You can only work after 430pm and on Sundays for a few weeks Then we can put you back on a normal shift Just make sure to keep yourself clean If someone comes up to you and Bob and offers to buy a magazine say you havent got one or if its obvious you have say they are promised for regular customers And dont get involved It was all good advice of course The problem was that other people might want toget involved And so they did One Sunday afternoon Bob and I had headed to Covent Garden to do a couple of hours work Given the restrictions on us we had to take whatever chances we could get We were sitting near the coordinators spot on James Street when I was suddenly aware of a large and rather threatening presence It was a guy called Stan Stan was a wellknown figure inBig Issue circles Hed worked for the company for years The problem was that he was a bit unpredictable When he was in the right frame of mind he could be the nicest guy youd ever met He would do anything for you and frequently did Hed bailed me out and given me a couple of free papers on a couple of occasions However when Stan was in a bad mood or even worse drunk he could be the most objectionable argumentative and aggressive pain in the arse in the world I quickly spotted that it was the latter Stan who was now standing in front of me Stan was a big guy all of six feet four He leaned down over me and bellowedYou arent supposed to be here you are banned from the area I could smell his breath it was like a distillery I had to stand my ground No Sam said I could come over here on Sunday or after 430pm I said Fortunately another guy who worked with Sam Peter was there as well and he backed me up much to Stans annoyance He lurched back for a moment then move backed in breathing whisky fumes all over me once more He was looking at Bob now and not in a friendly way If it was up to me Id strangle your cat right now he said His words really freaked me out If hed made a move towards Bob I would have attacked him I would have defended him like a mother defending her child Its the same thing He was my baby But I knew that would be fatal from theBig Issues point of view It would be the end So I made two decisions there and then I picked up Bob and headed elsewhere for the afternoon I wasnt going to work anywhere near Stan when he was in this mood But I also made the decision to move away from Covent Garden It would be a wrench Bob and I had a loyal customer base there and besides anything else it was a fun place to work The inescapable truth however was that it was becoming an unpleasant and even a dangerous place to work Bob and I needed to move to a less competitive part of London somewhere where I wasnt so well known There was one obvious candidate I used to busk around the Angel tube station in Islington before I went to Covent Garden It was a good area less lucrative than Covent Garden but still worthwhile So I decided the next day to take a visit to the coordinator there a great guy called Lee who I knew a little bit What are the chances of me getting a good pitch here I asked him Well Camden Passage is pretty busy as is the Green but you could do outside the tube station if you like he said No one fancies it much I had a feeling of déjà vu It was Covent Garden all over again For otherBig Issue sellers in London tube stations were reckoned to be a complete nightmare the worst possible places to try and sell the paper The way the theory went was that people in London are simply moving too fast they dont have time to slow down make the decision to buy one and dip into their pockets Theyve got to be somewhere else they are always in a hurry As Id discovered at Covent Garden however Bob had the magical ability to slow them down People would see him and suddenly they werent in quite such a rush It was as if he was providing them with a little bit of light relief a little bit of warmth and friendliness in their otherwise frantic impersonal lives Im sure a lot of people bought aBig Issue as a thank you for me giving them that little moment So I was more than happy to take what was supposed to be adifficult pitch right outside Angel tube We started that same week I left the Covent Garden vendors to it Almost immediately we began to get people slowing down to say hello to Bob We had soon picked up where we had left off in Covent Garden One or two people recognised us One evening a welldressed lady in a business suit stopped and did a sort of double take Dont you two work in Covent Garden she said Not any more madam I said with a smile not any more Chapter 16 Angel Hearts The move to Angel had definitely met with Bobs seal of approval I only had to look at his body language each day as we headed to work When we got off the bus at Islington Green he wouldnt ask to climb on my shoulders in the way he tended to do when wed been in central London Instead most mornings he would take the lead and march purposefully ahead of me down Camden Passage past all the antique stores cafés pubs and restaurants and along towards the end of Islington High Street and the large paved area around the tube station entrance Sometimes wed need to head to theBig Issuecoordinator on the north side of the Green so wed take a different route If that was the case hed always make a beeline for the enclosed garden area at the heart of the Green Id wait and watch while he rummaged around in the overgrowth sniffing for rodents birds or any other poor unsuspecting creature upon which he could test his scavenging skills So far hed drawn a blank but it didnt seem to dampen his enthusiasm for sticking his head into every nook and cranny in the area When we eventually arrived at his favourite spot facing the flower stall and the newspaper stand near one of the benches by the entrance to the Angel tube station he would stand there and watch me go through the arrival ritual placing my bag down on the pavement and putting a copy of theBig Issue in front of it Once all this was done he would sit himself down lick himself clean from the journey and get ready for the day I felt the same way about our new stamping ground After all the trouble Id had at Covent Garden over the years Islington seemed like another fresh start for us both I felt like we were starting a new era and that this time it was going to last The Angel was different from Covent Garden and the streets around the West End in lots of subtle ways In central London the streets were mostly crammed with tourists and in the evenings West End revellers and theatregoers The Angel wasnt quite as busy but the tube station still saw a mass of humanity pouring in and out each day It was a distinctively different type of person though There were still a lot of tourists of course many of them drawn to the restaurants and arty venues like Sadlers Wells and the Islington Business Design Centre But it was also a more professional and for want of a better word moreupmarket place Each evening Id notice hordes of people in business suits heading in and out of the tube station The bad news was that most of them barely even registered the fact that there was a ginger cat sitting outside the station The good news was that a large proportion of those who did slow down and spot him took an instant shine to Bob They were also really generous I noticed immediately that the average purchase and tip at Islington was just that little bit bigger than in Covent Garden The Angel locals were also generous in a different kind of way to those in Covent Garden Almost as soon as we began selling theBig Issue there people began giving Bob bits of food The first time it happened was on our second or third day A very smartly dressed lady stopped for a chat She asked me whether we were going to be there every day from now on which struck me as a bit suspicious Was she going to make some sort of complaint I was completely off the mark however The following day she appeared with a small Sainsburys bag containing some cat milk and a pouch of Sheba There you go Bob she said happily placing them on the pavement in front of Bob Hell probably have that at home tonight if thats OK I said thanking her Of course she said As long as he enjoys it thats the main thing After that more and more locals started donating titbits for him Our pitch was down the road from a large Sainsburys supermarket It soon became obvious that people were going in there to do their normal shopping and were picking up a little treat for Bob on their way round They would then drop their presents off on their way back home One day just a few weeks after we began at Angel about half a dozen different people did this By the end of the day I couldnt fit all the tins of cat milk pouches of food and tins of tuna and other fish that had been piling up all day into my rucksack I had to keep it all in a large Sainsburys bag When I got back to the flat it filled up an entire shelf in one of the kitchen cupboards It kept us going for almost a week The other thing that was a world apart from Covent Garden was the attitude of the staff at the tube station At Covent Garden I was the Antichrist a hate figure almost I could count the number of people with whom Id forged a good friendship in the years Id been busking or selling theBig Issue there on the fingers of one hand In fact I didnt even need that I could think of two at most By contrast the staff at Angel were really warm and generous towards Bob from the very beginning One day for instance the sun had been blazingly hot The mercury must have been up in the 90s at one point Everyone was walking around in shirt sleeves even though technically it was autumn I was sweating like crazy in my black jeans and black Tshirt I deliberately placed Bob in the shade of the building behind us so that he didnt get too hot I knew that heat was bad for cats An hour or so after wed set up our pitch it became clear to me that Id soon need to get some water for Bob But before I was able to do something a figure appeared from inside the tube station with a nice clean steel bowl brimming with clear water I recognised the lady immediately Her name was Davika one of the ticket attendants shed stopped to talk to Bob on numerous occasions already Here you go Bob she said stroking him on the back of the neck as she placed the bowl in front of him Dont want you getting dehydrated now do we she said He wasted no time in diving in and lapped it up in no time whatsoever Bob had always had this ability to endear himself to people but it never ceased to amaze me just how many seemed to become devoted to him He had won the Islington crowd over in a matter of weeks It was amazing really Of course it wasnt perfect at the Angel This was London after all It could never have been all sweetness and light The biggest problem was the concentration of people working the area around the tube station Unlike Covent Garden where all the surrounding streets were alive with activity at the Angel things tended to be concentrated around the tube So as a result there were a lot of other people operating on the streets from people dishing out free magazines to charity workers or chuggers as they were known This was one of the biggest changes that Id noticed since Id started working on the streets a decade earlier The streets were very much more competitive than they used to be The chuggers were mostly hyperenthusiastic young people working for charities Their job was to collar wellheeled commuters and tourists and get them to listen to a spiel about their charity They would then try to persuade them to sign up for direct debits to be taken from their bank accounts It was like being mugged by a charity hence their nickname chuggers Some were third world charities others were health related to do with cancer or other illnesses like cystic fibrosis and Alzheimers I didnt have a problem with them being there but it was the way they hassled people that annoyed me I had my own sales spiel for theBig Issue of course But I wasnt as intrusive or as nagging as some of these They would follow people down the road engaging them in conversations they didnt want to have As a result of this I would see people emerge from the tube station see a wall of these enthusiastic canvassers usually in their loud coloured Tshirts and make a run for it A lot of them were potentialBig Issue buyers so it was very annoying If someone was really driving people away I would have a word Some of the canvassers were fine about it They respected me and gave me my space But others didnt One day I got into a heated argument with a young student with a mop of Marc Bolanlike curls Hed been really irritating people by bouncing around and walking alongside them as they tried to get away I decided to have a word Hey mate youre making life difficult for the rest of us who are working here I said trying to be civil about it Can you just move along the road a few yards and give us some space Hed got really antsy about it Ive got every right to be here he said You cant tell me what to do and I will do what I want If you want to get someones back up you just need to say something like that So I put him straight on the fact that while he was trying to make pocket money to fund his gap year I was trying to make money to pay for my electricity and gas and to keep a roof over my and Bobs head His face kind of sank when I put it in those terms The other people who were a real irritant for me were the people who sold the assorted free magazines that were being published now Some of them likeStyleListandShortList were actually goodquality magazines so they caused me no end of problems the simplest of which boiled down to a question why were people going to pay for my magazine when they could get a free one from these people So whenever one strayed into my area Id try to explain it to them Id say to them straight up We all need to work so you need to give me some space to do my job you need to be at least twenty feet away It didnt always work however often because a lot of the vendors who sold these magazines didnt speak English Iwould try to explain the situation to them but they didnt understand what I was trying to say to them Others simply didnt want to listen to my complaints By far the most annoying people to work the streets around me however were the bucket rattlers the charity workers who would turn up with large plastic buckets collecting for the latest cause Again I sympathised with a lot of the things for which they were trying to raise money Africa environmental issues animal rights They were all great worthwhile charities But if the stories I had heard about how much of the money disappeared into the pockets of some of these bucket shakers were true I didnt have much sympathy A lot of them didnt have licences or any kind of meaningful accreditation If you looked at the laminated badges around their necks they could have been something from a kids birthday party They looked amateurish Yet despite this they were allowed inside the tube stations a place that was an absolute nogo zone for aBig Issue seller It would really nark me when I saw a bucket rattler inside the concourse hassling people Sometimes they would be standing right up against the turnstiles By the time they emerged out of the station the commuters and visitors were usually in no mood to be persuaded to buy theBig Issue It was I suppose a bit of a reversal of roles In Covent Garden I had been the maverick who hadnt stuck to the designated areas and bent the laws a bit Now I was on the receiving end of that I was the only licensed vendor in the area outside the tube station And Id worked out the areas that I could and couldnt stray into with the other main sellers there the newspaper vendor and the florist in particular The chuggers hawkers and bucket rattlers ran roughshod over those rules I guess some people would have thought it was ironic but there were times when I failed to see the funny side of it I have to admit Chapter 17 Fortyeight Hours The young doctor at the DDU the drug dependency unit scribbled his signature at the bottom of the prescription and handed it over to me with a stern expression on his face Remember take this then come back to me at least fortyeight hours later when you can feel the withdrawal symptoms have really kicked in he said holding my gaze Its going to be tough but it will be a lot tougher if you dont stick to what Ive said OK OK I understand I nodded picking myself up and heading out of his treatment room Just hope I can do it See you in a couple of days Id been turning up at my fortnightly consultations for a couple of months since wed first talked about coming off methadone I thought I was ready for it but my counsellors and doctors obviously didnt share that opinion Each time Id come in they had kept postponing it Id not got any kind of explanation as to why this was Now at last they had decided it was time I was going to make the final step towards being clean The prescription the counsellor had just given me was for my last dose of methadone Methadone had helped me kick my dependence on heroin But Id now tapered down my usage to such an extent that it was time to stop taking it for good When I next came to the DDU in a couple of days time I would be given my first dose of a much milder medication Subutex which would ease me out of drug dependency completely The counsellor described the process as like landing an aeroplane which I thought was a good analogy In the following months he would slowly cut back my dosage until it was almost nonexistent As he did so he said I would slowly drop back down to earth landing hopefully with a very gentle bump As I waited for the prescription to be made up today I didnt really dwell on the significance of it My head was too busy with thoughts about what lay ahead during the next fortyeight hours The counsellor had explained the risk to me in graphic detail Coming off methadone wasnt easy In fact it was really hard Id experience clucking or cold turkey a series of unpleasant physical and mental withdrawal symptoms I had to wait for those symptoms to become quite severe before I could go back to the clinic to get my first dose of Subutex If I didnt Irisked having whats known as a precipitated withdrawal This was basically a much worse withdrawal It didnt bear thinking about I was confident at this point that I could do it But at the same time I had an awful niggling feeling that I could fail and find myself wanting to score something that would make me feel better But I just kept telling myself that I had to do this I had to get over this last hurdle Otherwise it was going to be the same the next day and the next day and the day after that Nothing was going to change This was the reality that had finally dawned on me Id been living this way for ten years A lot of my life had just slipped away Id wasted so much time sitting around watching the days vanish When you are dependent on drugs minutes become hours hours become days It all just slips by time becomes inconsequential you only start worrying about it when you need your next fix You dont even care until then But thats when it becomes so awful Then all you can think about is making money to get some more Id made huge progress since Id been in the depths of my heroin addiction years earlier The DDU had really put me back on track But I was just sick of the whole thing now Having to go to a chemist every day having to visit the DDU every fortnight Having to prove that I hadnt been using I had had enough I now felt like I had something to do with my life In a way Id made it harder on myself by insisting on doing it alone I had been offered the chance several times to join Narcotics Anonymous but I just didnt like the whole twelvestep programme I couldnt do that kind of quasireligious thing Its almost like you have to give yourself up to a higher power It just wasnt me I realised that I was making life even more difficult for myself by taking that route The difference was I didnt think I was on my own now I had Bob As usual I didnt take him with me to the DDU clinic I didnt like exposing him to the place It was a part of my life I wasnt proud about even though I did feel Id achieved a lot since Id first visited When I got home he was pleased to see me especially as Id stopped off at the supermarket on the way home and had a bag full of goodies intended to get us through the next two days Anyone who is trying to get rid of an addictive habit knows what it is like Whether its trying to give up cigarettes or alcohol the first fortyeight hours are the hardest You are so used to getting your fix that you cant think of anything else The trick is to think of something else obviously And thats what I hoped to do And I was just really grateful that I had Bob to help me achieve it That lunchtime we sat down in front of the television had a snack together and waited The methadone generally lasted for around twenty hours so the first part of the day passed easily enough Bob and I played around a lot and went out for a short walk so that he could do his business I played a really old version of the originalHalo 2 game on my knackered old Xbox At that point it all seemed to be plain sailing I knew it couldnt stay that way for much longer Probably the most famous recreation of someoneclucking is in the filmTrainspotting in which Ewan McGregors character Renton decides to rid himself of his heroin addiction He is locked in a room with a few days of food and drink and left to get on with it He goes through the most horrendous physical and mental experience you can imagine getting the shakes having hallucinations being sick Allthat stuff Everyone remembers the bit where he imagines he is climbing inside the toilet bowl What I went through over the next fortyeight hours felt ten times worse than that The withdrawal symptoms began to kick in just after twentyfour hours after Id had my dose of methadone Within eight hours of that I was sweating profusely and feeling very twitchy By now it was the middle of the night and I should have been asleep I did nod off but I felt like I was pretty much conscious all the time It was a strange kind of sleep full of dreams or more accurately hallucinations Its hard to recollect exactly but I do remember having these lucid dreams about scoring heroin There were a lot of these dreams and they always went the same way I would either score and spill it score and not be able to get a needle into my vein or score but then get arrested by the police before I could use it It was weird It was obviously my bodys way of registering the fact that it was being denied this substance that it had once been used to being fed every twelve hours or so But it was also my subconscious trying to persuade me that maybe it was a good idea to start using it again Deep in my brain there was obviously this huge battle of wills going on It was almost as if I was a bystander watching it all happen to someone else It was strange Coming off heroin years ago wasnt as bad The transition to methadone had been reasonably straightforward This was a different experience altogether Time ceased to have any real meaning but by the following morning I was beginning to experience really bad headaches almost migrainelevel pains As a result I found it hard to cope with any light or noise Id try and sit in the dark but then Id start dreaming or hallucinating and want to snap myself out of it It was a vicious circle What I needed more than anything was something to take my mind off it all which was where Bob proved my salvation There were times when I wondered whether Bob and I had some kind of telepathic understanding He could definitely read my mind sometimes and seemed to be doing so now He knew that I needed him so he was a constant presence hanging around me snuggling up close when I invited him but keeping his distance when I was having a bad time It was as if he knew what I was feeling Sometimes Id be nodding off and he would come up to me and place his face close to me as if to say You all right mate Im here if you need me At other times he would just sit with me purring away rubbing his tail on me and licking my face every now and again As I slipped in and out of a weird hallucinatory universe he was my sheet anchor to reality He was a godsend in other ways too For a start he gave me something to do I still had to feed him which I did regularly The process of going into the kitchen opening up a sachet of food and mixing it in the bowl was just the sort of thing I needed to get my mind off what I was going through I didnt feel up to going downstairs to help him do his business but when I let him out he dashed off and was back upstairs again in what seemed like a few minutes He didnt seem to want to leave my side Id have periods where I didnt feel so bad During the morning of the second day for instance I had a couple of hours where I felt much better Bob and I just played around a lot I did a bit of reading It was hard but it was a way to keep my mind occupied I read a really good nonfiction book about a Marine saving dogs in Afghanistan It was good to think about what was going on in someone elses life By the afternoon and early evening of the second day however the withdrawal symptoms were really ramping up The worst thing was the physical stuff I had been warned that when you go throughclucking you get whats called restless legs syndrome In effect you have incredibly uncomfortable nervous pulses that run through your body making it impossible for you to sit still I started doing this My legs would suddenly and involuntarily start kicking its not called kicking the habit for nothing I think this freaked Bob out a bit He gave me a couple of odd sideways looks But he didnt desert me he stayed there at my side That night was the worst of all I couldnt watch television because the light and noise hurt my head When I went into the dark I just found my mind racing filling up with all kinds of crazy sometimes scary stuff All the time my legs were kicking and I was feeling extremes of hot and cold One minute I was so hot I felt like I was inside a furnace The next Id feel ice cold The sweat that had built up all over me would suddenly start to freeze and suddenly Id be shivering So then Id have to cover up and would start burning up again It was a horrible cycle Every now and again Id have moments of lucidity and clarity At one point I remember thinking that I really understood why so many people find it so hard to kick their drug habits Its a physical thing as well as a mental thing That battle of wills thats going on in your brain is very onesided The addictiveforces are definitely stronger than those that are trying to wean you off the drugs At another point I was able to see the last decade and what my addiction had done to me I saw and sometimes smelled the alleys and underpasses where Id slept rough the hostels where Id feared for my life the terrible things Id done and considered doing just to score enough to get me through the next twelve hours I saw with unbelievable clarity just how seriously addiction screws up your life I had some weird almost surreal thoughts as well For instance at one point it occurred to me that if I was to wake up with amnesia Id get through the withdrawal because I wouldnt know what was wrong with me A lot of my problems stemmed from the fact my body knew exactly what was wrong with me and what I could do to fix it I wont deny that there were moments of weakness when it crossed my mind when I imagined scoring But I was able to fend those thoughts off pretty easily This was my chance to kick it maybe my last chance I had to stay strong I had to take it the diarrhoea the cramps the vomiting the headaches the wildly fluctuating temperatures all of it That second night seemed to last forever Id look up at the clock and it seemed at times as if it was moving backwards Outside it seemed as if the darkness was getting deeper and blacker rather than brightening up for morning It was horrible But I had my secret weapon Bob did annoy me at certain points At one stage I was lying as still and quiet as possible just trying to shut out the world All of a sudden I felt Bob clawing at my leg digging into my skin quite painfully Bob what the hell are you doing I shouted at him a bit too aggressively making him jump Immediately I felt guilty I suspect he was worried that I was a little too still and quiet and was checking up to make sure I was alive He was worried about me Eventually a thin soupy grey light began to seep through the window signalling that morning had arrived at last I hauled myself out of bed and looked at the clock It was almost eight oclock I knew the clinic would be open by nine I couldnt wait any longer I splashed some cold water on my face It felt absolutely awful on my clammy skin In the mirror I could see that I looked drawn and my hair was a sweaty mess But I wasnt going to worry about that at this point Instead I threw on some clothes and headed straight for the bus stop Getting to Camden from Tottenham at that time of the day was always a trial Today it seemed much worse Every traffic light was on red every road seemed to have a long tailback of traffic It really was the journey from hell As I sat on the bus I was still having those huge temperature swings sweating one moment shivering the next my limbs were still twitching every now and again although not as badly as during the middle of the night People were looking at me as if I was some kind of nutcase I probably looked unbelievably bad At that point I didnt care I just wanted to get to the DDU I arrived just after nine and found the waiting room half full already One or two people looked as rough as I felt I wondered whether theyd been through fortyeight hours as hellish as those Id just been through Hi James how are you feeling the counsellor said as he came into the treatment room He only needed to look at me to know the answer of course but I appreciated his concern Not great I said Well youve done well do get through the last two days Thats a huge step youve taken he smiled He checked me over and got me to give a urine sample He then gave me a tablet of Subutex and scribbled out a new prescription this time for some Subutex That should make you feel a lot better he said Now lets start easing you off this and out of this place completely I stayed there for a while to make sure the new medication didnt have any odd side effects It didnt Quite the opposite in fact it made me feel a thousand times better By the time I had got back to Tottenham I felt completely transformed It was a different feeling from what Id experienced on methadone The world seemed more vivid I felt like I could see hear and smell more clearly Colours were brighter Sounds were crisper It was weird It may sound strange but I felt more alive again I stopped on the way and bought Bob a couple of new flavoured Sheba pouches that had come on to the market I also bought him a little toy a squeezy mouse Back at the flat I made a huge fuss of him We did it mate I said We did it The sense of achievement was incredible Over the next few days the transformation in my health and life in general was huge It was as if someone had drawn back the curtains and shed some sunlight into my life Of course in a way someone had Chapter 18 Homeward Bound I didnt think Bob and I could have become closer but the experience wed just been through together tightened our bond even more In the days that followed he stuck to me like a limpet almost watching over me in case I had some kind of relapse There was no danger of that however I felt better than I had done in years The thought of returning to the dark dependencies of the past made me shiver I had come too far now to turn back I decided to celebrate my breakthrough by doing up the flat a little bit So Bob and I put in a few extra hours each day outside the tube station and then used the proceeds to buy some paint a few cushions and a couple of prints to put on the wall I then went along to a good secondhand furniture shop in Tottenham and bought a nice new sofa It was a burgundy red heavyduty fabric with a bit of luck the sort of material that would be able to resist Bobs claws The old one was knackered partly down to natural wear and tear but also because of Bobs habit of scratching at its legs and base Bob was banned from scratching the new one As the weeks passed and the nights turned even darker and colder we spent more and more time curled up on the new sofa I was already looking forward to a nice Christmas for me and Bob although as it turned out that was a little premature It wasnt often that I got post apart from bills so when I saw a letter in my mailbox in the hallway of the flats one morning in early November 2008 I immediately noticed it It was an airmail envelope and had a postmark Tasmania Australia It was from my mother Wed not been in proper contact for years However despite the distance that had formed between us the letter was very chatty and warm She explained that she had moved to a new house in Tasmania She seemed to be very happy there The main point of her letter however was to offer me an invitationIf I was to pay your air fares to Australia and back would you come and see me she asked She explained that I could come over the Christmas holidays She suggested I could also take in a trip to Melbourne to see my godparents to whom Id once been very close Let me know she said signing off Love Mum There would have been a time when Id have thrown the letter straight into the dustbin Id have been defiant and stubborn and too proud to take a handout from my family But Id changed my head was in a different place now I had started to see life a lot more clearly and I could almost feel some of the anger and paranoia that Id felt in the past falling away So I decided to give it some thought It wasnt a straightforward decision far from it There were lots of pros and cons to take into consideration The biggest pro obviously was that Id get to see my mother again No matter what ups and downs wed had over the years she was my mother and I missed her Wed been in contact a couple of times since Id fallen through the cracks and ended up on the streets but Id never been honest with her about what had really happened Wed met once in the past ten years when shed come to England briefly Id gone to meet her in a pub near Epping Forest Id taken the District Line up there and spent three or four hours with her When Id not returned as expected after six months Id spun her a story about having formed a band in London and said I wasnt going to come back to Australia while we were trying to make it big I stuck to that story when I met her in the pub I hadnt felt great about telling her a pack of lies but I didnt have the courage or the strength to tell her that I was sleeping rough hooked on heroin and basically wasting my life away I had no idea whether she believed me or not At that point in my life I really didnt care Wed talked occasionally after that but frequently I would go for months on end without making contact which had obviously caused her a lot of grief Shed gone to amazing lengths to get hold of me at times I hadnt thought to ring her when the 77 bombings happened in London in July 2005 I was thankfully nowhere near the blasts but stuck on the other side of the world my mother had no idea that I was all right Nick whom she was still with was serving in the police force in Tasmania at the time Somehow he managed to persuade a member of the Met to do him and my mum a favour They looked me up on their records and sent a couple of cops round to my BB in Dalston one morning They scared the living daylights out of me when they arrived banging on the doors Dont worry mate you havent done anything wrong one of them said when I opened the door looking petrified probably There are just a couple of people on the other side of the world who want to know you are alive I had been tempted to make a joke and say that theyd almost given me a heart attack but I decided against it They didnt look like they were that pleased to have been given the job of checking up on me I contacted Mum and reassured her that I was OK Again I hadnt even considered that somebody else might have been concerned about me I didnt think that way at that time I was on my own and concerned only with my own survival But now Id changed After all the years of neglect and deception it would be a chance to make it up to her and to put the record straight I felt like I needed to do that The other obvious positive was that Id get to have a decent holiday in the sun something that I had been deprived of for years living in London and working mostly in the evenings I still felt drained by the experience of switching to my new medication and knew that a few weeks in a nice environment would do me the power of good My mother told me she was living on a little farm way out in the middle of nowhere near a river It sounded idyllic Australia or more specifically the Australian landscape had always occupied a special place in my heart Reconnecting with it would be good for my soul The list of pros were long The list of cons however was even longer And at the top of the list was my biggest concern of all Bob Who would look after him How could I be sure hed be there waiting for me when I got back Did I actually want to be separated from my soulmate for weeks on end The answer to the first question presented itself almost immediately The moment I mentioned it Belle volunteered to look after him at her flat I knew she was totally trustworthy and would take care of him But I still wondered what the effect would be on him The other big concern was money My mother might have been offering to pay for my fare but I still wouldnt be allowed into Australia without any money I did some digging around and found that Id need at least £500 in cash to gain admittance I spent a few days weighing up both sides of the argument but eventually decided Id go Why not A change of scenery and some sunshine would do me good I had a lot to do For a start I had to get a new passport which wasnt easy given the way my life had disintegrated in recent years A social worker gave me a hand and helped me organise the necessary paperwork including a birth certificate I then had to sort out the flights The best deal by far was to fly with Air China to Beijing and then down to Melbourne It was a much longer journey and involved a lengthy stopoff in Beijing But it was way cheaper than anything else on the market My mother had given me an email address by now I sent her an email with all the details including my new passport number A few days later I got a confirmation email from the website through which my mother had booked the tickets I was on my way All I had to do now was raise£500 Easy The flight Id found was heading to Australia in the first week of December So for the next few weeks I worked every hour of the day in all weather Bob came with me most days although I left him at home when it was raining heavily I knew he didnt like it and I didnt want to risk him catching a chill or getting ill before I went away There was no way Id be able to go to Australia knowing he was ill again I was soon saving up a bit of cash which I kept in a little tea caddy Id found Slowly but surely it began to fill up As my departure date loomed into view I had enough to make the trip I headed to Heathrow with a heavy heart Id said goodbye to Bob at Belles flat Hed not looked too concerned but then he had no idea I was going to be away for the best part of six weeks I knew hed be safe with Belle but it still didnt stop me fretting I really had become a paranoid parent If Id imagined the trip to Australia was going to be a nice relaxing adventure I was sorely mistaken The thirtysix hours or so it took me was an absolute nightmare It started quietly enough The Air China flight to Beijing took eleven hours and was uneventful I watched the inflight movie and had a meal but I found it hard to sleep because I wasnt feeling fantastic It was partly because of my medication but partly also because of the damp London weather Maybe Id spent too many hours selling theBig Issue in the pouring rain I had a horrendous cold and kept sneezing all the way through the flight I got a few funny looks from the air stewardesses and some of my fellow passengers when I had a bad attack but thought nothing of it until we landed in Beijing As we taxied towards the terminal there was an announcement from the captain over the tannoy It was in Chinese first but there was then an English translation It basically said that we should stay in our seats until we were asked to leave the plane Odd I thought The next thing I saw was two uniformed Chinese officials wearing facemasks They were walking down the aisle straight towards me When they got to me one of them produced a thermometer An air stewardess was standing there to translateThese men are from the Chinese government They need to take your temperature she said OK I said sensing this wasnt the time to argue I opened wide and sat there while one of the officials kept looking at his watch After theyd muttered something in Chinese the air hostess said You need to go with these men to undergo some routine medical checks It was 2008 and we were at the height of the swine flu scare China in particular was being incredibly nervous about it Id watched a report on the news a few days earlier in which theyd talked about the way people were being turned away from China if there was the slightest hint of them being infected A lot of people were being placed in quarantine and held there for days So I was a bit apprehensive as I walked off with them I had visions of me being holed up in some Chinese isolation ward for a month They ran all sorts of tests on me from blood tests to swabs They probably found all sorts of interesting things but they found no trace of swine flu SARS or anything else contagious After a couple of hours a mildly apologetic official told me that I was free to go The only problem was that I now had to make my way back to my connecting flight and I was lost inside the humongous hangarlike space that is Beijing airport I had about three hours to find my luggage and my connecting flight It had been years since Id spent any time in an airport terminal Id forgotten how big and soulless they were and this one was especially so I had to take a train from one part of Terminal 3 to another part After a few wrong turns I found my connecting flight less than an hour before it was due to take off I breathed a huge sigh of relief when I sank into my seat on the plane and slept like a log on the flight to Melbourne mainly through exhaustion But then at Melbourne I hit another snag As I made my way through the customs area I was suddenly aware of a Labrador dog sniffing animatedly at my luggage Excuse me sir would you mind coming this way with us a customs guard said Oh God I thought Im never going to get to meet my mother I was taken to an inspection room where they started going through my stuff They then ran an electric drug detector over my bag I could tell there was a problem from the expressions on their faces Im afraid your luggage has tested positive for cocaine the guard said I was gobsmacked I had no idea how that was possible I didnt take cocaine and didnt really know anyone who did None of my friends could afford it As it turned out they said that it wasnt illegal for me to have traces of it for private use If you are a casual user and its for private consumption all you have to do is tell us and you can be on your way the guard said I explained my situationIm on a drug recovery programme so I dont take anything casually I said I then showed them a letter I had from my doctor explaining why I was on Subutex Eventually they had to relent They gave me a final pat down and released me By the time I emerged from the customs area almost an hour had passed I had to get another flight down to Tasmania which took another few hours By the time I got there it was early evening and I was utterly exhausted Seeing my mother was wonderful She was waiting at the airport in Tasmania and gave me a couple of really long hugs She was crying She was pleased to see me alive I think I was really happy to see her too although I didnt cry The cottage was every bit as lovely as shed described it in her letter It was a big airy bungalow with huge garden space at the back It was surrounded by farmland with a river running by the bottom of her land It was a very peaceful picturesque place Over the next month I just hung out there relaxing recovering and rebooting myself Within a couple of weeks I felt like a different person The anxieties of London were literally thousands of miles away just over ten thousand to be precise My mums maternal instincts kicked in and she made sure I was fed well I could feel my strength returning I could also sense me and my mother were repairing our relationship At first we didnt talk in great depth about things but in time I began to open up Then one night as we sat on the veranda watching the sun go down I had a couple of drinks and suddenly it all came out It wasnt a big confession there was no Hollywood drama I just talked and talked The emotional floodgates had been waiting to burst open for a while now For years I had used drugs to escape from my emotions in fact to make sure I didnt have any Slowly but surely Id changed that And now my emotions were coming back As I explained some of the lows Id been through over the last ten years my mother looked horrified as any parent would have done I guessed you werent doing so great when I saw you but I never guessed it was that bad she said close to tears At times she just sat there with her head in her hands muttering the wordwhy every now and again Why didnt you tell me youd lost your passport Why didnt you call me and ask for help Why didnt you contact your father Inevitably she blamed herself for it She said she felt like shed let me down but I told her I didnt blame her The reality was that I had left myself down Ultimately there was no one else to blame You didnt decide to sleep in cardboard boxes and get off your face on smack every night I did I said at one point That set her off crying as well Once wed broken the ice so to speak we talked much more easily We talked a little about the past and my childhood in Australia and England I felt comfortable being honest with her I said that Id felt shed been a distant figure when Id been younger and that being raised by nannies and moving around a lot had had an impact on me Naturally that upset her but she argued that shed been trying to provide an income for us to keep a roof over our heads I took her point but I still wished shed been there more for me We laughed a lot too it wasnt all dark conversation We admitted how similar we were and chuckled at some of the arguments we used to have when I was a teenager She admitted that there had been a big conflict of personality there Im a strong personality and so are you Thats where you get it from she said But we spent most of the time talking about the present rather than the past She asked me all sorts of questions about the rehab process Id been through and what I was hoping to achieve now that I was almost clean I explained that it was still a case of taking one step at a time but that with luck Id be totally clean within a year or so Sometimes she just simply listened which was something she hadnt always done And so did I I think we both learned a lot more about each other not least the fact that deep down we were very similar which is why we clashed so much when I was younger During those long chats I often talked about Bob Id brought a photo of him with me which I showed everyone and anyone who took an interest He looks a smart cookie my mother smiled when she saw it Oh he is I said beaming with pride I dont know where Id been now if it wasnt for Bob Spending time in Australia was great It allowed me to clear my mind It also allowed me to take stock of where I was and where I wanted to go from here There was a part of me that hankered to move back I had family here There was more of a support network than I had in London certainly But I kept thinking about Bob and the fact that hed be as lost without me as Id be without him I didnt take the idea seriously for very long By the time Id started my sixth week in Australia I was mentally already on the plane back to England I said goodbye to my mother properly this time She came to the airport with me and waved me off on my way to Melbourne where I was going to spend some time with my godparents They had been quite significant figures in my youth They had owned what was then the biggest private telecom company in Australia and were the first to form a radio pager company in the country so had a lot of money at one point As a boy naturally I used to love spending time at the mansion theyd built in Melbourne I even lived with them for a while when me and my mother werent getting on very well Their reaction to my story was the same as my mothers they were shocked They offered to help me out financially and even to find me work in Australia But again I had to explain that I had responsibilities back in London The journey back was much less eventful than the outward trip I felt much better fitter and healthier and probably looked it so I didnt attract so much attention at customs or immigration control I was so rested and revived by my time in Australia that I slept for most of the trip I was dying to see Bob again although a part of me was concerned that he might have changed or even forgotten me I neednt have had any concerns The minute I walked into Belles flat his tail popped up and he bounced off her sofa and ran up to me Id brought him back a few little presents a couple of stuffed kangaroo toys He was soon clawing away at one of them As we headed home that evening he immediately scampered up my arm and on to my shoulders as usual Inan instant the emotional and physical journey Id made to the other side of the world was forgotten It was me and Bob against the world once more It was as if Id never been away Chapter 19 The Stationmaster Australia had been great it had given me a boost both physically and emotionally Back in London I felt stronger and more sure of myself than Id felt in years Being reunited with Bob had lifted my spirits even more Without him a little part of me had been missing down in Tasmania Now I felt whole again We were soon back into the old routine sharing every aspect of our daytoday life Even now after almost two years together he remained a constant source of surprise to me Id talked endlessly about Bob while I was away telling everyone how smart he was There had been times Im sure when people looked at me as if I was crazy A cat cant be that smart Im sure they were thinking A couple of weeks after I got back however I realised that Id been underselling him Doing his business had always been a bit of a chore for Bob Hed never taken to the litter trays that Id bought him I still had a few packs of them in the cupboard gathering dust Theyd been there since day one It was a real palaver having to go all the way down five flights of stairs and out into the grounds to do his business every single time he needed to go to the loo Id noticed in the past few months before Id gone to Australia and again now that I was back that he wasnt going to the toilet downstairs so often any more For a while Id wondered whether it might be a medical problem and Id taken him to the Blue Cross truck on Islington Green to have him checked out The vets found nothing untoward and suggested that it might just be a change in his metabolism as he got older The explanation was actually far less scientific and a lot more funny than that One morning soon after Id got back from Australia I woke up really early around 630am My body clock was still all over the place I hauled myself out of bed and stepped blearyeyed towards the toilet The door was half open and I could hear a light tinkling sort of noiseWeird I thought I half expected to find someone had sneaked into the flat to use the toilet but when I gently nudged open the door I was greeted by a sight that left me totally speechless Bob was squatting on the toilet seat It was just like that scene in the movieMeet the Parents when Robert De Niros cat Mr Jinxie does the same thing Except in this case it was absolutely real Bob had obviously decided that going to the toilet downstairs was too much of a hassle So having seen me go to the toilet a few times in the past three years hed worked out what he needed to do and simply mimicked me When he saw me staring at him Bob just fired me one of his withering looks as if to sayWhat are you looking at Im only going to the loo what could be more normal than that He was right of course Why was I surprised at anything Bob did He was capable of anything surely I knew that already Our absence for a few weeks had definitely been noticed by a lot of the locals at the Angel During our first week back on the pitch a succession of people came up to us with big smiles Theyd say things like Ah youre back or I thought youd won the lottery They were almost all genuine warmhearted welcomes One lady dropped off a card withWe Missed You written on it It felt great to be home As ever of course there were also one or two who werent so pleased to see us One evening I found myself getting into a very heated argument with a Chinese lady Id noticed her before looking rather disapprovingly at me and Bob This time she approached me waving her finger at me as she did so This not right this not right she said angrily Sorry whats not right I said genuinely baffled This not normal for cat to be like this she went on Him too quiet you drug him You drug cat That was the point at which I had to take issue with her It was far from the first time that someone had insinuated this Back in Covent Garden when wed been busking a very snotty professorial guy had stopped one day and told me in no uncertain terms that he was on to me I know what youre doing And I think I know what youre giving him to stay so docile and obedient he said a bit too pleased with himself And what would that be then sir I said Ah that would give you the advantage and you would be able to change to something else he said a bit taken aback that I was challenging him No come on youve made an accusation now back it up I said stepping up my defence He had disappeared into thin air fairly quickly probably quite wisely because I think I might have planted one on him if hed carried on like that The Chinese woman was basically making the same accusation So I gave her the same defence What do you think I am giving him that makes him like that I said I dont know she said But you giving him something Well if I was drugging him why would he hang around with me every day Why wouldnt he try and make a run for it when he got the chance I cant drug him in front of everyone Psssh she said waving her arms at me dismissively and turning on her heels It not right it not right she said once more as she melted into the crowd This was a reality that Id accepted a long time ago I knew there were always going to be some people who were suspicious that I was mistreating Bob didnt like cats or simply didnt like the fact aBig Issue seller had a cat rather than a dog which was far more common A couple of weeks after the row with the Chinese lady I had another confrontation a very different one this time Since the early days in Covent Garden Id regularly been offered money for Bob Every now and again someone would come up to me and ask How much for your cat Id usually tell them to go forth and multiply Up here at the Angel Id heard it again from one lady in particular She had been to see me several times each time chatting away before getting to the point of her visit Look James she would say I dont think Bob should be out on the streets I think he should be in a nice warm home living a better life Each time shed end the conversation with a question along the lines of So how much do you want for him Id rebuff her each time at which point shed start throwing figures at me Shed started at one hundred pounds then gone up to five hundred Most recently shed come up to me one evening and said Ill give you a thousand pounds for him Id just looked at her and said Do you have children Erm yes as a matter of fact I do she spluttered a bit thrown You do OK How much for your youngest child What are you talking about How much for your youngest child I hardly think thats got anything to do I cut her offActually I think it does have a lot to do with it As far as Im concerned Bob is my child hes my baby And for you to ask me whether Id sell him isexactly the same as me asking you how much you want for your youngest child Shed just stormed off I never saw her again The attitude of the tube station staff was the complete polar opposite of this One day I was talking to one of the ticket inspectors Vanika She loved Bob and was chuckling at the way countless people were stopping and talking to him and taking his picture Hes putting Angel tube station on the map isnt he she laughed He is you should put him on the staff like that cat in Japan who is a stationmaster He even wears a hat I said Im not sure weve got any vacancies she giggled Well you should at least give him an ID card or something I joked She looked at me with a thoughtful look on her face and went away I thought nothing more about it A couple of weeks later Bob and I were sitting outside the station one evening when Vanika appeared again She had a big grin on her face I was immediately suspicious Whats up I said Nothing I just wanted to give Bob this she smiled She then produced a laminated travel card with Bobs photograph on it Thats fantastic I said I got the picture off the Internet she said to my slight amazement What the hell was Bob doing on the Internet So what does it actually mean I said It means that he can travel as a passenger for free on the underground she laughed I thought that cats went free anyway I smiled Well it actually means we are all very fond of him We think of him as part of the family It took a lot of willpower to stop myself from bursting into tears Chapter 20 The Longest Night The spring of 2009 should have been on its way but the evenings remained dark and dismal By the time I finished selling theBig Issue at Angel around seven oclock most evenings dusk was already descending and the streetlights were blazing into life as were the pavements After being quiet during the early months of the year when there were fewer tourists around the Angel had suddenly come alive The early evening rush hour was as busy as Id ever seen it with what seemed like hundreds of thousands of people pouring in and out of the tube station Maybe it was the wellheeled crowds The change had attracted other people to the area as well unfortunately Living on the streets of London gives you really welldeveloped radar when it comes to sussing out people whom you want to avoid at all costs It was around 630 or 7pm during the busiest part of the day for me when a guy who had set off that radar a few times loomed into view Id seen him once or twice before luckily from a distance He was a really roughlooking character I know I wasnt exactly the most wellgroomed guy on the streets of London but this guy was really scraggy He looked like he was sleeping rough His skin was all red and blotchy and his clotheswere smeared in dirt What really stuck out about him however was his dog a giant Rottweiler It was black with brown markings and from the moment I first saw it I could tell immediately that it was aggressive The sight of them walking around together reminded me of an old drawing of Bill Sikesand his dog Bulls Eye inOliver Twist You could tell they were never far away from trouble The dog was with him this evening as he arrived near the tube station entrance and sat down to talk to some other shiftylooking characters who had been sitting there drinking lager for an hour or more I didnt like the look of them at all Almost immediately I could see that the Rottweiler had spotted Bob and was straining at the lead dying to come and have a go at him The guy seemed to have the big dog under control but it was by no means certain that it would stay that way He seemed more interested in talking to these other guys and getting stuck into their lager As it happened I was in the process of packing up for the evening in any case The gangs arrival only cemented that decision in my mind I had a bad feeling about them and the dog I wanted to get myself and Bob as far away from them as possible I began gathering up myBig Issues and placing my other bits and pieces in my rucksack All of a sudden I heard this really loud piercing bark What happened next seemed like it was in slow motion a bad action scene from a bad action movie I turned round to see a flash of black and brown heading towards me and Bob The guy had obviously not tethered the lead correctly The Rottweiler was on the loose My first instinctive reaction was to protect Bob so I just jumped in front of the dog Before I knew it hed run into me bowling me over As I fell I managed to wrap my arms around the dog and we ended up on the floor wrestling I was shouting and swearing trying to get a good grip on its head so that it couldnt bite me but the dog was simply too strong Rottweilers are powerful dogs and I have no doubt that if the fight had gone on a few seconds longer Id have come off second best God only knows what sorts of wounds it would have inflicted Fortunately I was suddenly aware of another voice shouting and I felt the power of the dog waning as it was pulled in another direction Come here you f the owner was shouting pulling as hard as he could on the lead He then walloped the dog across the head with something blunt I dont know what it was but the sound was sickening In different circumstances Id have been worried for the dogs welfare but my main priority was Bob He must have been terrified by what had just happened I turned to check on him but found the spot where hed been sitting empty I spun around 360 degrees to see if someone had perhaps picked him up to protect him but there was no sign of him Hed disappeared Suddenly I realised what Id done I had a pile ofBig Issues a short distance away from our pitch under a bench Bobs lead didnt extend that far so in my anxiety to get away from the Rottweiler and his owner I had unclipped the lead from my belt It had only been for a second or two while I gathered everything together but that had been long enough That was my big mistake The Rottweiler must have been watching it all and Bob and must have spotted this Thats why hed broken free and charged at us at that precise moment I was immediately thrown into a blind panic A few people had gathered around to ask me if I was OK Im fine Anyone seen Bob I said even though I wasnt actually fine Id hurt myself when the Rottweiler had knocked me over and I had cuts to my hands where hed bitten me At that moment a regular customer of mine appeared a middleaged lady who often gave Bob treats She had clearly seen the commotion and came over I just saw Bob running off in the direction of Camden Passage she said I tried to grab his lead but he was too quick Thanks I said as I just grabbed my rucksack and ran my chest pounding My mind immediately flashed back to the time hed run off in Piccadilly Circus For some reason though this felt like a more serious situation Back then he had basically been spooked by a man in a funny outfit This time hed been in real physical danger If I hadnt intervened the Rottweiler would almost certainly have attacked him Who knows what impact the sight of the charging dog had had on him Perhaps it was a reminder of something hed seen in his past I had no idea what he must be feeling although I guessed he was as frightened and distressed as me I ran straight towards Camden Passage dodging the early evening crowds milling around the pubs bars and restaurants Bob Bob I kept calling drawing looks from passersby Anyone seen a ginger tom running this way with his lead trailing after him I asked a group of people standing outside the main pub in the passage They all just shrugged their shoulders I had hoped that just as he had done that time back in Piccadilly Circus Bob would find refuge in a shop But by now most of them were shuttered up for the evening It was only the bars restaurants and cafés that were open As I made my way down the narrow lane and asked around I was greeted by nothing but shakes of the head If hed gone beyond Camden Passage heading north then he would have ended up on Essex Road the main road leading to Dalston and beyond Hed walked part of that route before but never at night or on his own I was beginning to despair when I met a woman towards the end of the Passage a short distance before it opens out opposite Islington Green She pointed down the road I saw a cat running down the road that way she said It was going like a rocket it didnt look like it was going to stop It was veering towards the main road it looked like it was thinking about crossing At the end of the passage I emerged out on to the open street and scanned the area Bob was fond of Islington Green and often stopped to do his business there It was also where the Blue Cross vans would park It was worth a look I quickly crossed the road and ran into the small enclosed grassy area There were some bushes there where he often rummaged around I knelt down and looked inside Even though the light had gone and I was barely able to see my hand in front of me I hoped against hope that I might see a pair of bright eyes staring back at me Bob Bob are you here mate But there was nothing I walked down to the other corner of the enclosed Green and shouted a couple more times But apart from groans from a couple of drunks who were sitting on one of the benches all I could hear was the insistent droning of the traffic I left the Green and found myself facing the big Waterstones bookshop Bob and I often popped in there and the staff there always made a fuss of him I knew I really was clutching at straws now but maybe he had headed there for refuge It was quiet inside the store and some of the staff were getting ready to shut up for the evening There were just a few people browsing the shelves I recognised one of the ladies behind the till By now I was sweating breathing heavily and must obviously have looked agitated Are you all right she asked Ive lost Bob A dog attacked us and Bob ran off He didnt come in here did he Oh no she said looking genuinely concerned Ive been here and Ive not seen him But let me ask upstairs She picked up the phone and dialled to the other department You havent seen a cat up there have you she said The slow shake of her head that followed told me all I needed to know Im really sorry she said But if we do see him well make sure to keep him Thanks I said It was only then as I wandered back out of Waterstones and into the now dark evening that it hit me Ive lost him I was in bits For the next few minutes I was in a daze I carried on walking down Essex Road but by now I had given up on asking in the cafés restaurants and pubs This was the route we came in every day and went home again every night When I saw a bus bound for Tottenham another thought formed in my frazzled mind He couldnt have Could he There was an inspector standing at one of the bus stops and I asked him whether hed seen a cat getting on a bus I knew Bob he was smart enough to do it But the guy just looked at me like Id asked him whether hed seen aliens getting on the number 73 He just shook his head and turned away from me I knew cats had a great sense of direction and have been known to make long journeys But there was no way he was going to find his way all the way back to Tottenham It was a good three and a half miles through some pretty rough parts of London Wed never walked that way wed only ever done it on the bus I quickly decided that was simply a nonstarter The next half hour or so was a rollercoaster of conflicting emotions One minute Id convince myself that he couldnt stray far without being found and identified Loads of people locally knew who he was And even if he was found by someone who didnt know him if they were sensible they would see that he was microchipped and would know that all his data was at the national microchip centre No sooner had I reassured myself of that than a stream of very different consciousness began washing over me as all of a sudden a nightmare series of thoughts started pinging away in my head This might have been what happened three years ago This might have been how hed come to end up in my block of flats that spring evening This might have been the trigger for him to decide it was time to move on again Inside I was utterly torn The logical sensible side of me was saying He will be OK youll get him back But the wilder more irrational side of me was saying something much bleaker It was saying Hes gone you wont see him again I wandered up and down Essex Road for the best part of an hour It was now pitch dark and the traffic was snarled up virtually all the way back to the end of Islington High Street I was all at sea Ireally didnt know what to do Without really thinking I just started walking down Essex Road towards Dalston My friend Belle lived in a flat about a mile away Id head there I was walking past an alleyway when I saw a flash of a tail It was black and thin very different to Bobs but I was in such a state my mind was playing tricks and I convinced myself it must be him Bob I shouted diving into the dark space but there was nothing there Somewhere in the dark I heard a meowing sound It didnt sound like him After a couple of minutes I moved on By now the traffic had eased off The night suddenly fell ominously quiet For the first time I noticed that the stars were out It wasnt quite the Australian night sky but it was still impressive A few weeks ago Id been staring at the stars in Tasmania Id told everyone in Australia that I was coming back to care for BobA fine job Ive done of that I said inwardly cursing myself For a moment or two I wondered whether my extended stay in Australia had actually been a factor in all this Had that time apart loosened the ties between me and Bob Had the fact that Id been absent for six weeks made him question my commitment to him When the Rottweiler had attacked had he decided that he could no longer rely on me to protect him The thought made me want to scream As Belles road loomed into view I was still feeling close to tears What was I going to do without him Id never find a companion like Bob again It was then that it happened For the first time in years I experienced an overwhelming need for a fix I tried to bat it away immediately but once more my subconscious started fighting a battle of wills Somewhere inside my head I could feel myself thinking that if I really had lost Bob I wouldnt be able to cope Id have to anaesthetise myself from the grief I was already feeling Belle had like me been fighting for years But I knew her flatmate still dabbled The closer I got to her street the more terrifying the thoughts in my head were becoming By the time I reached Belles house it was approaching ten oclock I had been wandering the streets for a couple of hours In the distance the sirens were wailing once more the cops were on their way to another stabbing or punchup in a pub I couldnt have cared less As I walked up the path to the dimly lit front entrance I spotted a shape sitting quietly in the shadows to the side of the building It was unmistakably the silhouette of a cat but Id given up hope by now and just assumed it was another stray sheltering from the cold But then I saw his face that unmistakeable face Bob He let out a plaintive meow just like the one in the hallway three years ago as if to sayWhere have you been Ive been waiting here for ages I scooped him up and held him close You are going to be the death of me if you keep running away like that I said my mind scrambling to work out how hed got here It wasnt long before it all fell into place I felt a fool for not thinking of it sooner He had been to Belles flat with me several times and spent six weeks there when I was away It made sense that he would have come here But how on earth had he got here It must be a mile and a half from our pitch at the Angel Had he walked all the way If so how long had he been here None of that mattered now As I carried on making a fuss of him he licked my hand his tongue was as rough as sandpaper He rubbed his face against mine and curled his tail I rang Belles doorbell and she invited me in My mood had been transformed from despair to delirium I was on top of the world Belles flatmate was also there and said Want something to celebrate smiling knowingly No Im fine thanks I said tugging on Bob as he scratched playfully at my hand and looking over at Belle Just a beer would be great Bob didnt need drugs to get through the night He just needed his companion me And at that moment I decided that was all I needed too All I needed was Bob Not just tonight but for as long as I had the privilege of having him in my life Chapter 21 Bob TheBig Issue Cat As the March sun disappeared and dusk descended over the Angel London was winding itself up for the evening once more The traffic was already thick on Islington High Street and the honking of horns was building into a cacophony of noise The pavements were busy too with a stream of people flowing in and out of the station concourse The rush hour was under way and living up to its name as usual Everyone was in a rush to get somewhere it seemed Well not quite everyone I was checking that I had enough papers left to cope with the surge of activity I knew was about to arrive when I saw out of the corner of my eye that a group of kids had gathered around us They were teenagers I guessed three boys and a couple of girls They looked South American or maybe Spanish or Portuguese There was nothing unusual about this It wasnt quite Covent Garden Leicester Square or Piccadilly Circus but Islington had its fair share of tourists and Bob was a magnet for them Barely a day went by without him being surrounded by an excitable group of youths like this What was different this evening however was the way they were animatedly pointing and talking about him Ahsi Bob said one teenage girl talking what I guessed was Spanish Si si Bob the Beeg Issew Cat said another Weird I thought to myself when I realised what shed saidHow do they know his name is Bob He doesnt wear a name tag And what do they mean by theBig Issue Cat My curiosity soon got the better of me Sorry I hope you dont mind me asking but how do you know Bob I said in the hope that one of them spoke decent English My Spanish was almost nonexistent Fortunately one of them a young boy repliedOh we see him on YouTube he smiled Bob is very popular yes Is he I said Someone told me he was on YouTube but Ive got no idea how many people watch it Many people I think he smiled Where are you from España Spain So Bobs popular in Spain Si si another one of the boys said when the boy translated back our conversation Bob es una estrella en España Sorry what did he say I asked the boy He says that Bob is a star in Spain I was shocked I knew that lots of people had taken photographs of Bob over the years both while I was busking and now that I was selling theBig Issue Id jokingly wondered once whether he should be put forward for theGuinness Book of Records the worlds most photographed cat A couple of people had filmed him too some with their phones others with proper video cameras I started casting my mind back over those that had shot footage of him in recent months Who could have shot a film that was now on YouTube There were a couple of obvious candidates but I made a note to check it out at the first opportunity The following morning I headed down to the local library with Bob and booked myself online I punched in the search terms Bob Big Issue Cat Sure enough there was a link to YouTube which I clicked on To my surprise there was not one but two films there Hey Bob look he was right You are a star on YouTube He hadnt been terribly interested until that point It wasnt Channel Four racing after all But when I clicked on the first video and saw and heard myself talking he jumped on to the keyboard and popped his face right up against the screen As I watched the first film which was calledBobcat and I the memory came back to me Id been approached by a film student Hed followed me around for a while back during the days when we were selling theBig Issue around Neal Street There was nice footage of us there and of us getting on the bus and walking the streets Watching the film it gave a pretty good summary of the daytoday life of aBig Issue seller There were clips of people fussing over Bob but also a sequence where I was confronted by some guys who didnt believe he was a tame cat They belonged to the same group of people who thought I was drugging him The other video had been filmed more recently around the Angel by a Russian guy I clicked on the link for that and saw that hed called his film Bob TheBig IssueCat This must have been the one that the Spanish students had seen I could see that it had had tens of thousands of hits I was gobsmacked The feeling that Bob was becoming some kind of celebrity had been building for a while Every now and again someone would sayAh is that Bob Ive heard about him Or Is this the famous Bobcat Id always assumed it was through word of mouth Then a few weeks before meeting the Spanish teenagers we had featured in a local newspaper theIslington Tribune Id even been approached by an American lady an agent who asked me whether Id thought about writing a book about me and Bob As if The Spanish teenagers made me realise that it had begun to morph into something much more than local celebrity Bob was becoming a feline star As I headed towards the bus stop and absorbed what I had just discovered I couldnt help smiling On one of the films I had said that Bob had saved my life When I first heard it I thought it sounded a bit crass a bit of an exaggeration too But as I walked along the road and put it all into perspective it began to sink in it was true he really had In the two years since Id found him sitting in that halflit hallway he had transformed my world Back then Id been a recovering heroin addict living a handtomouth existence I was in my late twenties and yet I had no real direction or purpose in life beyond survival Id lost contact with my family and barely had a friend in the world Not to put too fine a point on it my life was a total mess All that had changed My trip to Australia hadnt made up for the difficulties of the past but it had brought me and my mother back together again The wounds were being healed I had the feeling we were going to become close again My battle with drugs was finally drawing to a close or at least I hoped it was The amount of Subutex I had to take was diminishing steadily The day when I wouldnt have to take it all was looming into view on the horizon I could finally see an end to my addiction There had been times when Id never imagined that was possible Most of all Id finally laid down some roots It might not have seemed much to most people but my little flat in Tottenham had given me the kind of security and stability that Id always secretly craved Id never lived for so long in the same place Id been there more than four years and would remainthere even longer There was no doubt in my mind that would not have happened if it hadnt been for Bob I was raised as a churchgoer but I wasnt a practising Christian I wasnt an agnostic or atheist either My view is that we should all take a bit from every religion and philosophy Im not a Buddhist but I like Buddhist philosophies in particular They give you a very good structure that you can build your life around For instance I definitely believe in karma the idea that what goes around comes around I wondered whether Bob was my reward for having done something good somewhere in my troubled life I also wondered sometimes whether Bob and I had known each other in a previous life The way we bonded together the instant connection that we made that was very unusual Someone said to me once that we were the reincarnation of Dick Whittington and his cat Except the roles had been reversed this time around Dick Whittington had come back as Bob and I was his companion I didnt have a problem with that I was happy to think of him in that way Bob is my best mate and the one who has guided me towards a different and a better way of life He doesnt demand anything complicated or unrealistic in return He just needs me to take care of him And thats what I do I knew the road ahead wouldnt be smooth We were sure to face our problems here and there I was still working on the streets of London after all It was never going to be easy But as long as we were together I had a feeling it was going to be fine Everybody needs a break everybody deserves that second chance Bob and I had taken ours Acknowledgements Writing this book has been an amazing collaborative experience one in which so many people have played
